## 2026-04-26 — Audit entry: COMMUNICATION_CONTRACT bootstrap + AUTOCONTINUE-001 revert

**Audit result**: `AUDIT_PARTIAL` — in-repo dispatcher passes; Downloads-side autocontinue cannot be verified from this Cowork sandbox.

**Scope**: agentic-coordination infrastructure (AGENT_BUS, AGENTS, registry/, dashboard/, scripts/agent_next_instruction.py, claimed Downloads/codex_autocontinue.py update).

**Findings**:

1. **`scripts/agent_next_instruction.py` — PASS.**
   The canonical in-repo dispatcher exists with correct structure:
   `REPO_ROOT`, `TASKS_FILE`, `HISTORY_FILE`, `STATE_FILE`, `BUS_FILE`,
   `LOCK_FILE` constants; `VALID_AGENTS = {Codex, Cowork}`;
   `PRIMARY_STATUSES = {READY, PARTIAL}`, `FALLBACK_STATUSES = {IN_PROGRESS, FUTURE}`,
   `NEVER_DISPATCH = {DONE, CANCELLED, BLOCKED}`; `STALE_HOURS = 6`;
   lock-file based serialization for atomic JSONL appends. Complies with the
   COMMUNICATION_CONTRACT clauses 1, 3, 11.

2. **`registry/agent_history.jsonl` — PASS.**
   Append-only, JSONL valid, contains the `history_repair` event from the
   parallel-write race (good — Codex self-corrected with file-lock rather than
   silently overwriting). Demonstrates the system has self-healing properties.

3. **`AGENT_BUS.md` — PASS (post-bootstrap).**
   Now contains the `COMMUNICATION_CONTRACT` section with all 13 clauses
   from the human directive of 2026-04-26.

4. **`dashboard/agent_state.json` — PASS.**
   Schema valid (`project`, `strategic_goal`, `current_phase`,
   `current_baton_owner`, `next_task_id`, `last_completed_task`,
   `last_dispatched_task`, `last_dispatched_agent`, `open_blockers`,
   `open_recommendations`, `unconditionality_status`, `claim_policy`,
   `always_has_next_task`).

5. **`UNCONDITIONALITY_LEDGER.md` — PASS.**
   Status `NOT_ESTABLISHED`. Three-row ledger (CLAY-GOAL BLOCKED,
   AGENTIC-INFRA CONDITIONAL_BRIDGE, AUTOCONTINUE CONDITIONAL_BRIDGE).
   Honest. No overclaim.

6. **`C:\Users\lluis\Downloads\codex_autocontinue.py` — UNVERIFIABLE FROM SANDBOX.**
   Codex claimed DONE on 2026-04-26 with validation commands listed but no
   stdout transcript or file snapshot reachable from the Cowork sandbox.
   Per `AGENTS.md` §2 (done-criteria require auditable evidence) and §3.2
   ("I trust Codex" does NOT count as validation), the DONE claim cannot
   stand. **Reverted to `READY` priority 1.** See
   `REC-AUDIT-AUTOCONTINUE-MIRROR-001` in `registry/recommendations.yaml`.

**Repair task created**: `COWORK-AUDIT-AUTOCONTINUE-001` (FUTURE, owner Cowork; auto-activates when Codex provides Cowork-readable evidence — see recommendation REC-AUDIT-AUTOCONTINUE-MIRROR-001).

**Recommendations added**: 1 (`REC-AUDIT-AUTOCONTINUE-MIRROR-001`).

**Mathematical-honesty status**: unchanged. No row in `UNCONDITIONALITY_LEDGER.md` was upgraded to `FORMAL_KERNEL`. No claim about Clay-level progress was made or accepted. The two existing caveats (NC1-WITNESS vacuous, CONTINUUM-COORDSCALE not genuine continuum) remain on the surface in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.

**Cowork session impact**: infrastructure-only. Zero Lean files modified.

## REC-AUDIT-AUTOCONTINUE-MIRROR-001 (open)

Status: OPEN
Author: Cowork
Priority: 1
Converts to task: `AUTOCONTINUE-001` (modified) + `COWORK-AUDIT-AUTOCONTINUE-001`

Codex must dump the literal stdout of
`python C:\Users\lluis\Downloads\codex_autocontinue.py Codex` and `… Cowork`
to `dashboard/autocontinue_validation.txt`, plus the full contents of
`C:\Users\lluis\Downloads\codex_autocontinue.py` to
`dashboard/codex_autocontinue_snapshot.py`. Cowork will diff the snapshot
against `scripts/agent_next_instruction.py` to detect silent divergence.

## REC-BOOTSTRAP-001 (closed by REC-AUDIT-AUTOCONTINUE-MIRROR-001)

Status: SUPERSEDED-BY-REC-AUDIT-AUTOCONTINUE-MIRROR-001

Recommendation: Replace generic continuation with structured task dispatch
from `registry/agent_tasks.yaml`, with history and dashboard updates.

Reason: The project needs persistent auditability and task control for long-term
Clay-level formalization work.

Resolution note: in-repo dispatcher delivered; Downloads-side dispatcher
delivery is now tracked under `REC-AUDIT-AUTOCONTINUE-MIRROR-001`.
