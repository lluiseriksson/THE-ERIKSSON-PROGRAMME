# Sharp KP, step 1 — pinned cluster weights

Anchor of the sharp-KP campaign (`docs/SHARP-KP-PLAN.md`, Route A).  The
sharp Kotecký–Preiss estimate is a statement about clusters **pinned at a
polymer**: under the KP criterion alone (no uniform majorant of the
weights), the pinned weighted sum is finite per polymer — the form that
survives the infinite-volume limit, since the *total* cluster sum is
extensive and cannot be volume-uniform.

This file provides the object and its exact relation to the total weight:

* `pinnedClusterWeight P c n` — the contribution of size-`(n+1)` tuples
  whose 0-th coordinate is `c`;
* `pinnedClusterWeight_nonneg`;
* `clusterWeight_eq_sum_pinned` — **exact pinning decomposition**:
  `clusterWeight P n = ∑_c pinnedClusterWeight P c n` (fiberwise over the
  0-th coordinate; no overcounting, since pinning is at a fixed coordinate
  rather than by membership);
* `pinnedClusterWeight_le_clusterWeight` — each pin is dominated by the
  total.

The campaign's target (`kp_pinned_cluster_bound`, see the plan) bounds
`∑_n pinnedClusterWeight`-type sums by `e^{a(c)} − 1` under `KPCriterion`.

Oracle target: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. No sorry, no axioms.
