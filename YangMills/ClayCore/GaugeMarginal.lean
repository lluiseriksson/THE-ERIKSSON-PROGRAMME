# Single-edge marginal of the product gauge measure

The lattice gauge measure `gaugeMeasureFrom μ` (`L1_GibbsMeasure/GibbsMeasure.lean`) is
the product Haar measure on gauge configurations, expressed in positive-edge coordinates
as `(Measure.pi fun _ : PosEdge => μ).map gaugeConfigEquiv`.

This file proves its **single-edge marginal**: pushing `gaugeMeasureFrom μ` forward along
"evaluate the configuration at a fixed positive edge `e`" returns `μ` itself.  For a
probability measure `μ`, the other factors integrate to `1`, so each edge variable is
distributed exactly as `μ` — the first statement here about a genuine *gauge observable*
(an edge holonomy), and the measure-theoretic basis for reducing single-edge Wilson-line
expectations to a one-group Haar integral (e.g. `∫ ⟨open line⟩ = 0` via the centre engine).

Proof: `configToPos` is `gaugeConfigEquiv.symm`, so `eval e ∘ configToPos` is
`Function.eval e` on the product, and `Measure.map` composes; Mathlib's
`measurePreserving_eval` gives the product marginal `= μ`.

/-- **Single-edge observable reduces to a one-group integral.**  For any observable `f`
of a single edge holonomy, its expectation under the product gauge measure equals the
Haar integral of `f` over the group: `∫ f(A e) dμ_gauge = ∫ f dμ`.  This is the bridge
that turns a lattice gauge expectation of a one-edge observable into a single-group Haar
integral — where the centre-vanishing engine (`∫ χ dμ = 0` for non-trivial characters)
applies.  Proved by `integral_map` over the single-edge marginal. -/

/-- **Zero-mean single-edge observables have zero gauge expectation.**  If an observable
`f` has vanishing Haar mean `∫ f dμ = 0`, then its expectation under the full lattice
gauge measure also vanishes.  This is the lattice realization of the centre-vanishing
engine: an edge observable whose group integral is zero (e.g. a non-trivial U(1) Fourier
mode `fourier k`, `k ≠ 0`, or `tr U` on SU(N), both already proved to integrate to zero)
contributes zero to every lattice gauge expectation.  The first lattice gauge-observable
expectation computed end-to-end. -/
