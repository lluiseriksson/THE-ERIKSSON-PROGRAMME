# BALABAN GAUGE-RG CAMPAIGN — the continuum track

**Live status (2026-06-14).** Core green at **8262 jobs**.  The local
averaging-operator theory is complete; the later RG substrate now also includes
the free Gaussian pushforward, marginal-coupling summability, exponential-decay
kernel calculus, Schur/PSD/Gaussian bounds, animal counting, cube summability,
and explicit shell-growth summability (ledger Addenda 23–83).  The live
frontier is **`hRpoly`**: the concrete Yang-Mills
cluster-expansion-with-holes activity-decay bound for the actual gauge RG
operator.  See `CURRENT-STATE.md` for the short checkpoint.

**Original date:** 2026-06-12.  The ladder below is retained as the auditable
history of the campaign; individual rows may describe intermediate states that
have since been superseded by the live status above.

**Status detail (read before continuing).**  CLOSED, oracle-clean, in
`YangMillsCore`:

* **Geometry/maps** — B1 (`BlockLattice`), B2 (`BlockMaps`).
* **Averaging operators** — B3-linear (`LinearAveraging`: `linAvg`,
  linearity, locality `linAvg_congr`), B3-full interface
  (`GroupAverage` + non-vacuous `meanAverage`).
* **Gauge-covariance chain** — B4-prep holonomy law
  (`wilsonLine_gaugeAct_path`), B4 averaged-contour covariance
  (`averagedContour_gaugeAct`), B4-Ū algebra
  (`UbarBlock_conj`), B4-Ū lattice bridge (`MatrixRealization`,
  `rep_wilsonLine_gaugeAct`).
* **Near-identity log/exp layer** (`NearLog`) — `nearLog` definition +
  convergence + sharp `O(‖Y‖)` bound + `O(‖Y‖²)` linearisation; scalar
  correctness (`= Real.log`) and scalar `log(exp)=id`;
  conjugation-equivariance (single + finite-sum); operator-exp
  second-order remainder; **the quantitative axiom (0.8)**
  `exp(nearLog Y)=1+Y+O(‖Y‖²)`; small-field stability
  `‖exp(nearLog Y)-1‖ ≤ ‖Y‖+O(‖Y‖²)` (U1 ingredient).

The two things Bałaban's (0.5)–(0.12) framework demands of the averaging
operator — **gauge covariance and first-order linearisation** — are now
verified theorems, and the once-feared exact identity `log(exp)=id`
(M-log-2b) is demoted to optional (covariance never needed it; (0.8) is
obtained without it).

Historical OPEN note (superseded in detail by the live status above):
**B4-Ū full** and the **U1/U2 per-scale RG-stability campaign** were the
frontier at the time this plan opened.  Since then, much of the deterministic,
Gaussian, coupling, summability, and kernel substrate has been theorem-fed.
The remaining hard content is now localized to the concrete activity-decay
input `hRpoly`.  Direct Clay relevance remains ~0% (<0.1%): even a full UV
discharge leaves M4/M5 (continuum limit, OS/Wightman reconstruction) untouched.

The continuum-facing renormalization-group construction.  Goal: discharge
the §6.3 UV input of the M3 assembly (`lattice_mass_gap_of_per_scale_uv`,
ledger Add. 19) non-vacuously, by building Balaban's gauge-covariant
block-spin renormalization group against the existing
`gaugeMeasureFrom` / `FinBox` lattice core — NOT the vacuous
`ClayCore/Balaban*` scaffolding (which is correctly excluded;
UV-SHOPPING-LIST §1, §7).

## Lattice-core facts used

`FinBox d N := Fin d → Fin N` (the d-torus `(ℤ/N)^d`); `ConcreteEdge d N`
= `{source : FinBox d N, dir : Fin d, sign : Bool}`; `ConcretePlaquette
d N` = `{site, dir1, dir2, dir1 < dir2}`; `GaugeConfig d N G` the gauge
field.  Blocking with block size `L` requires the fine torus side to be
`L · N'`, coarsening to side `N'`.

**Status (2026-06-12):** the §6.3 UV obligation is a single oracle-clean
conditional (`lattice_mass_gap_of_cluster_and_coupling`) whose only
unproved input is the cluster-expansion **activity-decay** bound `hRpoly`
(`B7`'s carried hypothesis above).  Coupling flow, summability, and
gauge covariance are theorems or reduced to combinatorics; the
conditional is certified non-vacuous.  `hRpoly` is the genuine
months-scale next campaign.

## B3-full design UNBLOCKED (2026-06-12) — the axiomatic group average (CMP 109)

The CMP 98 eqs (14)–(15) OCR garble is no longer a hard blocker: **CMP
109 (1987) §0, eqs (0.5)–(0.12)** gives the construction in clean,
*axiomatic* form, and Balaban states (p.253, after (0.10)) that "the
considerations and results … do not depend on any particular averaging
operation used; they are valid universally for all averages satisfying
the above properties."  So the source-faithful, non-vacuous Lean route
for B3-full is to formalise **Balaban's axiomatic group average**, not a
single transcribed formula:

* a group average `M({U_j})` is a `G_c`-valued analytic function on
  finite sets of group elements of small diameter, with:
  permutation invariance `M(π{U_j}) = M({U_j})` (0.7); the near-identity
  **linearisation** `log M({exp A_j}) = (1/n) Σ_j A_j + O(‖A‖²)` (0.8)
  — this is exactly the tie to the linear operator `Q` (brick B3-linear,
  already built); group closure `U_j ∈ G ⟹ M ∈ G` (0.9);
* an explicit inhabitant: the **Federbush average** (0.10) — `M({U_j})`
  is the `U` near all `U_j` with `Σ_j log(U_j U⁻¹) = 0` (Federbush,
  ref. [35] of CMP 109);
* the gauge field average `Ū(c) = exp[ L^{-d} Σ_{x∈B(c₋)} log(U(c₋,x)·
  U(x,x(c))⁻¹·U(x(c),c₊)·U(-c)) ] · U(c)` (CMP 109 eq (0.12)), with
  `x(c) = x + L·e_μ` the block-translated site.

Revised B3-full plan: (i) define the `GroupAverage` interface
(axioms 0.7–0.9) — non-trivially constrained (a trivial/constant `M`
violates 0.7–0.8), so NOT vacuous; (ii) define `Ū` from it via (0.12);
(iii) Federbush inhabitation (0.10) and the analytic linearisation (0.8)
are the genuinely hard pieces, carried as interface obligations
(hypotheses, never axioms) until proved.  Strategy/framing: **Lluis
Eriksson** (ai.viXra:2602.0069, 2602.0088).

## Missing source (precise request)

The uploaded `Averaging operations.pdf` (CMP 98) has a clean OCR for the
**geometry** (eqs (1)–(5)) and the **gauge-covariance condition** (11),
but the **explicit averaging-operator formulas (14) and (15)** are
garbled by the scan (Greek/zeta symbols, the contour `Γ_{c,x}` and the
product structure are unreadable).  To implement **B3** source-faithfully
I need a **clean copy of CMP 98 page 19–20 (equations (14) and (15))**,
or the equivalent explicit definition from CMP 96 eq (1.8) (the *linear*
averaging operation the small-field limit reduces to).  Until then, B3 is
held; B1–B2 (pure geometry) and the small-field *linear* averaging (if eq
(1.8) of CMP 96 is legible) proceed independently.

## Honest scope

This is the continuum (M4) track.  Even fully completed it does not
touch OS/Wightman reconstruction (M5) or change the Clay distance
(~0%, <0.1%) until the continuum limit + reconstruction exist.  It is a
multi-month constructive-QFT formalization; each brick is oracle-checked
and the carried analytic inputs (CMP 109/122 estimates) remain explicit
hypotheses, never axioms, until proved.
