# Verification ledger — release audit of the KP/Penrose campaign

**Date:** 2026-06-10 · **Commit range audited:** `360bf3d..a3343f1` (30 commits)
**Build:** `lake build YangMillsCore` — **8209 jobs, green.**
**Source scan:** zero literal `sorry`/`axiom` declarations in `YangMills/KP/`

No declaration depends on anything beyond Lean's three standard axioms.

## What these are (plain language, with references)

* **Target A (closed):** the Ursell/Mayer coefficient on complete graphs
  satisfies `d(n+1) = −n·d(n)`, hence `φ(K_{n+1}) = (−1)ⁿ·n!`; the n=1 Mayer
  identity `Ξ = exp(clusterSum)` follows unconditionally.  [Classical
  cluster-expansion combinatorics; see e.g. Friedli–Velenik, *Statistical
  Mechanics of Lattice Systems*, Ch. 5.]
* **Penrose tree-graph inequality (closed):** `|φ(X)| ≤ #spanning trees of
  the incompatibility graph` — O. Penrose, *Convergence of fugacity
  expansions for fluids and lattice gases*, J. Math. Phys. 4 (1963) /
  partition-scheme form 1967; proved here via the greedy BFS scheme with
  Boolean-interval fibers.
* **Tree counting (closed):** `treeCount (m+1) ≤ (m+1)^(m+1)` by injectivity
  of the greedy parent map — sufficient (with `(n+1)ⁿ ≤ eⁿ·n!`) for the KP
  bound; no Prüfer bijection required.
* **Target B (closed):** the Kotecký–Preiss per-size estimate
  `clusterWeight P n ≤ (∑‖z‖)·(e·A)ⁿ` and convergence of the Mayer series
  for `e·A < 1` — R. Kotecký & D. Preiss, *Cluster expansion for abstract
  polymer models*, Comm. Math. Phys. 103 (1986); proved here under the
  **uniform** smallness `e·max(a) < 1` (slightly stronger than sharp KP;
  refinable).
* **M3 bridge (conditional, proved):** geometric IR cluster bound + UV
  suppression ⟹ uniform exponential decay with one positive gap
  (Osterwalder–Seiler-type assembly; the IR/UV inputs remain explicit
  hypotheses pending the polymer representation and UV bound).

## Addendum (2026-06-10, autonomous overnight session): T3 closed

Additional headline results, each `#print axioms` =
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, core green at 8212 jobs:

```
'YangMills.integral_centerAct'                       (gauge measure centre-invariant)
'YangMills.integral_wilsonLoop_eq_zero'              (selection rule, matrix units, abstract)
'YangMills.integral_wilsonLoopSU_eq_zero'            (selection rule at genuine SU(n) Haar)
'YangMills.wilsonAction_centerAct'                   (exact centre symmetry of the Wilson action)
'YangMills.integral_centerAct_gibbs'                 (interacting Gibbs measure centre-invariant)
'YangMills.integral_wilsonLoopSU_gibbs_eq_zero'      (Z_n selection rule, interacting, any β)
```

Plain language: the centre `Z_n ⊂ SU(n)` acts on lattice gauge fields by
multiplying every positively-oriented edge by `ω = e^{2πi/n}`; the product
Haar measure is invariant (Haar), and the Wilson action is *exactly*
invariant because every plaquette crosses two edges forward and two backward
(net centre charge zero).  A Wilson loop of length `L` is an eigenfunction
with eigenvalue `ω^L`, so its expectation — free **or interacting, at any
coupling** — vanishes unless `n | L`.  This is the lattice N-ality selection
rule (centre symmetry; cf. 't Hooft's centre-symmetry analyses and standard
LGT texts, e.g. Montvay–Münster §3), now machine-checked end to end.
Loops here are positively-oriented edge lists; the signed-length
generalization is routine and noted in `docs/T3-LG6-PLAN.md`.

## Addendum 2 (2026-06-10, continued autonomous session): polymer rep. step 1

Headline results, each `#print axioms` = `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`:

```
'YangMills.boltzmann_eq_sum_plaquetteSets'           (exp(-βS) = Mayer sum over plaquette sets)
'YangMills.partitionFunction_eq_sum_plaquetteSets''  (Z as polymer-gas sum, UNCONDITIONAL for
                                                      bounded measurable energies)
'YangMills.abs_plaquetteWeight_le'                   (|f_p| ≤ e^{|β|B} − 1, KP smallness seed)
'YangMills.measurable_plaquetteHolonomy'             (holonomies measurable)
'YangMills.integrable_boltzmann'                     (Boltzmann weight integrable, bounded pe)
'YangMills.partitionFunction_pos''                   (Z > 0, integrability hypothesis ELIMINATED)
'YangMills.gibbsMeasure_isProbability''              (Gibbs probability, hypothesis ELIMINATED)
```

Plain language: the Gibbs weight expands as `∏_p (1 + f_p)` with Mayer
weights `f_p = e^{-βE_p} − 1`, turning the partition function into a gas of
plaquette sets with activities uniformly `≤ e^{|β|B} − 1` — the
high-temperature polymer representation (standard; e.g. Montvay–Münster,
Seiler, *Gauge Theories as a Problem of Constructive QFT*), step 1 of
connecting the verified KP convergence to the lattice Gibbs theory.  The
integrability hypotheses previously carried by `partitionFunction_pos` and
`gibbsMeasure_isProbability` are now discharged for bounded measurable
plaquette energies (e.g. `Re tr` on a compact group).

## Addendum 3 (2026-06-10, autonomous loop, final): observables + correlators

Each `#print axioms` = `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`,
core green at 8214 jobs:

```
'YangMills.norm_wilsonLoopSU_le'                     (|W| ≤ n: trace bound on SU(n))
'YangMills.measurable_wilsonLoopSU'                  (W measurable; SU(n) MeasurableMul₂/Inv
                                                      instances built componentwise)
'YangMills.integrable_wilsonLoopSU_gibbs'            (W integrable under Gibbs — the
                                                      selection-rule expectations are
                                                      well-defined integrals)
'YangMills.integral_wilsonLoopSU_mul_gibbs_eq_zero'  (CORRELATOR selection rule: two-loop
                                                      Gibbs correlators vanish unless
                                                      n | L+L', any coupling)
```

Status of the M3 campaign after this run: T1 ✓, T2 (full KP convergence) ✓,
T3 (selection rules, free + interacting + correlator, with integrability) ✓,
polymer representation step 1 ✓ with three integrability hypotheses
eliminated.  Remaining: polymer step 2 (connected grouping + independence
factorization of the product measure — next campaign, multi-session),
UV bound, T4.  M4/M5: class C, open mathematics.

## Addendum 4 (2026-06-10, continued loop): the lattice gas, end to end

Each `#print axioms` = `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`:

```
'YangMills.plaquetteWeight_congr' / 'prod_plaquetteWeight_congr'   (locality)
'YangMills.integral_mul_of_disjoint_deps'                          (two-block independence,
                                                                    product measures, no hypotheses)
'YangMills.integral_prod_plaquetteWeight_mul_of_disjoint'          (gauge-level factorization)

'YangMills.latticeClusterSum_summable'                             (LATTICE MAYER SERIES CONVERGES)

'YangMills.abs_partitionFunction_sub_one_le'                       (|Z−1| ≤ (e^{|β|B})^{#P} − 1)
'YangMills.partitionFunction_pos_of_small'                         (quantitative Z > 0)
```

Plain language: the cluster expansion of finite-volume SU(N) lattice gauge
theory at small coupling is now machine-checked from the Boltzmann factor to
absolute convergence with explicit constants, with the partition function
quantitatively pinned near 1.  Thresholds are volume-dependent; the
volume-uniform refinement (connected polymers, lattice-animal entropy) is
the scoped remaining step.  All M3 lattice-side; M4/M5/Clay untouched.

## Addendum 5 (2026-06-10, continued loop): VOLUME-UNIFORMITY

The entropy campaign (`ConnectedEntropy.lean`), opened and **closed** in one
session.  Each `#print axioms` = `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`:

                                                                   ≤ (16d+1)^{2n} animals of size n+1
                                                                   through a point, volume-free)

```

Plain language: connected plaquette sets are ranges of lazy closed walks
(greedy growth via splicing), walks are counted by the degree bound `16d`,
so there are at most `(16d+1)^{2n}` connected polymers of size `n+1` through
any plaquette — **independent of the lattice volume** (standard
lattice-animal counting; cf. Friedli–Velenik Ch. 5/6, Simon, *The
Statistical Mechanics of Lattice Gases*).  Consequently the Kotecký–Preiss
criterion for the connected lattice gas holds under smallness conditions on
`β` depending **only on the dimension** — the volume-dependence caveat of
addendum 4 is **eliminated at the criterion level**.

~~Honest remaining caveat: composing this with our formalized KP
*convergence* theorem still passes through the uniform bound `a(c) ≤ A`~~
**RESOLVED — see addendum 6.**

## Addendum 6 (2026-06-10, the sharp-KP completion) — VOLUME-UNIFORM
CONVERGENCE, the campaign endpoint

**Build:** `lake build YangMillsCore` — 8223 jobs, green, at `708d318`.

```

Plain language: the **sharp (weight-respecting) Kotecký–Preiss bound is
fully machine-checked** — `∑_n (truncated pinned cluster sums) ≤
‖z(c)‖·e^{a(c)}` under the bare criterion, with NO uniform majorant of
the weights and NO geometric smallness hypothesis (FV Thm 5.4-level,
via the shell decomposition of `SharpShell.lean`: Penrose domination →
rooted depth-`D` tree-sums → block factorization priced by the
multinomial → the Borel-sum recursion `B_{D+1} ≤ exp(∑ ‖z‖·B_D)` →
induction to the `kpMajorant` → `e^{a(c)}`).  Composed with the
volume-uniform criterion (addendum 5), the Mayer cluster series of the
connected lattice polymer gas **converges absolutely under β-smallness
depending only on the dimension** — the `hA` caveat of addendum 5 is
eliminated; nothing in the convergence hypotheses references the
lattice volume.  All M3 lattice-side; M4/M5/Clay untouched.

## Addendum 7 (2026-06-10, the Mayer–Ursell inversion) — THE
FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CLUSTER EXPANSIONS

**Build:** `lake build YangMillsCore` — green at `b8dd5ee`.
**Source scan:** zero `sorry`/`axiom` in `YangMills/KP/` (unchanged).

Oracle outputs (verbatim, the headline chain of

'YangMills.KP.partition_eq_exp_clusterSum_of_kp'      [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
```

Plain language: **`Ξ = exp(clusterSum)` is fully machine-checked** —
for every finite polymer system with absolutely convergent cluster
series, and outright under the bare KP criterion (the sharp theory of
addendum 6 supplies the convergence).  This was the "months-long crux"
recorded in `Expansion.lean`'s header (E3, the deferred Mayer–Ursell
inversion).  The proof: the partition identity (sums of block-Ursell
products over all `Finpartition`s = the compatibility indicator,
via component-partition fibrations of the alternating subgraph sums),
the π-collapse to ordered partitions, the exact function-space split,
the multinomial count `#ordp(m)·∏mᵢ! = N!`, the injective collapse to
admissible sets, and the analytic shell (power Fubini, the master
sigma-sum, size regrouping with finite layers, tail-kill).  This
unlocks the cluster-correlation chain (`docs/CLUSTER-CORRELATION-PLAN.md`
Half B): correlators as differences of `log Ξ`-type quantities are now
expressible through cluster sums with the proved volume-uniform decay
engine (Half A).  All M3 lattice-side; M4/M5/Clay untouched.

## Addendum 8 (2026-06-11, the connecting decay + the `Z = Ξ` gate)

**Build:** `lake build YangMillsCore` — green at `6bba786` (8227 jobs).

'YangMills.partitionFunction_eq_exp_clusterSum'       [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
```

Plain language: two campaign endpoints.  (1) **The volume-uniform IR
decay mechanism** (`connecting_cluster_decay`,
`L1_GibbsMeasure/ClusterGeometry.lean`): the total pinned cluster sum
over clusters through `p` that also touch `q` is bounded by
`exp(−ε·d(p,q)/2)·x/(1−(16d+1)²x)` — every constant depends only on
`d, B, β, t, ε`.  (2) **The measure-side identification**
(`partitionFunction_eq_partition`,
`L1_GibbsMeasure/PolymerRepresentation.lean`): the Wilson-action
partition function equals the polymer-gas partition function of the
connected lattice gas — proved by the component bijection
(`plaqComponents`: parts of the reachability partition of the
touching graph; `componentFamily`: their instance-free polymer lift),
with values matched by the polymer factorization integral.  Composed
with addendum 7: **`Z = exp(clusterSum)` at high temperature**, hence
`Z ≠ 0`, with volume-uniform constants.  What remains for the IR
hypothesis of `lattice_mass_gap_of_clustering_uniform`: B2 (the
covariance identity for deformed gases) + B4 (assembly).  All M3
lattice-side; M4/M5/Clay untouched.

Plain language: the entire `Z = Ξ = exp(K)` chain now holds for
**arbitrary bounded measurable local weight families**, volume-uniformly
(`WeightedGas.lean` + `PolymerRepresentation.lean`).  Multiplicative
local observables `∏_{p∈T}(1+g_p)` absorb into deformed weights, the
four-gas inclusion–exclusion `K_{FG}+K−K_F−K_G` cancels termwise off
clusters connecting the two regions, and the endpoint is

    Z[FG]·Z = Z[F]·Z[G]·exp(connecting cluster sum)

— **the covariance identity**, division-free, with all constants
depending only on `d`, the weight bounds, and `t`.  Remaining for the
IR side of M3: bound the connecting sum by the (already proved,
Wilson-gas) exponential decay mechanism transported to the weighted
gas, and assemble `hIRbound`.  All M3 lattice-side; M4/M5/Clay
untouched.

## Addendum 10 (2026-06-11, B4 complete) — THE IR CLUSTERING BOUND,
END TO END

**Build:** `lake build YangMillsCore` — green at `e1de69b`.
**Source scan:** zero `sorry`/`axiom` (unchanged).

The final form (`gibbs_truncated_correlation_bound`): for observables
`O_R = ∏_{p∈R}(1+g_p)` over disjoint supports `S, T` at
touching-distance `≥ 2k`, in genuine Gibbs integrals over the Wilson
Boltzmann weight,

    |∫O_S·O_T·e^{−βS}·Z − ∫O_S·e^{−βS}·∫O_T·e^{−βS}| ≤ C·e^{−ε·k},

real absolute values, `C` explicit and volume-free.  Divide by
`Z² > 0` (`partitionFunction_pos'`) for the normalized covariance.

And the M3 adapter (`lattice_mass_gap_of_exp_clustering_uniform`,
`Paper/ClusteringToGap.lean`, oracle clean): the uniform lattice mass
gap consuming the IR bound in exactly this `e^{−εk}` shape
(`r := e^{−ε}`).  **The IR hypothesis of the strong-coupling lattice
mass gap is now fed by a theorem; the only hypothesis-carried input
left in the M3 assembly is the §6.3 single-scale UV bound (the
Balaban input, deliberately carried — never an axiom).**

And the T4 shortcut (`two_plaquette_correlator_bound`,
`L1_GibbsMeasure/TwoPlaquetteCorrelator.lean`, oracle clean at
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`): the connected
two-plaquette correlator of ANY bounded measurable holonomy
observable decays exponentially in the touching-distance at small
`β`, volume-free — the `kp_cluster_decay`-shaped endpoint of
`PETER_WEYL_ROADMAP.md` Layer 4, reached WITHOUT Peter–Weyl, Schur
orthogonality, or the Osterwalder–Seiler character expansion (those
layers were routes to polymer bounds the weighted-Mayer campaign
produced directly).  Peter–Weyl remains the route for the
area-law/Wilson-loop form.

And the normalized finale
(`two_plaquette_correlator_bound_normalized`, oracle clean): dividing
by `Z² > 0` cancels the partition function from the constant —

    |⟨f_p·f_q⟩ − ⟨f_p⟩·⟨f_q⟩| ≤ (8·M·(1+s)²/s²)·e^{−ε·k},

the genuine Gibbs covariance of bounded local holonomy observables,
with the constant depending only on `d, β, B, s, t, ε` — independent
of the lattice volume AND of `Z`.  **Exponential clustering of the
lattice gauge theory's two-point functions at small coupling is
machine-checked end to end.**

Non-vacuity (adversarial audit, `clustering_window_nonempty`, oracle
clean): at `t = ε = 1` the three smallness hypotheses are
simultaneously satisfiable for every dimension, with explicit
`δ₀(d) = ((K²+64d+8)·e³)⁻¹ > 0`; the `(β, s)`-window is nonempty —
the clustering theorems are not vacuous.

And the SU(N) capstone (`sun_two_plaquette_correlator_bound`, oracle
clean at `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`): the clustering
bound instantiated at the **genuine** Yang–Mills data — the gauge
group `SU(N_c)`, the Haar probability measure `sunHaarProb`, the
Wilson plaquette energy `Re tr U` (bounded by `N_c`).  **Exponential
clustering of two-point functions for the SU(N) Wilson lattice gauge
theory at strong coupling — actual group, actual measure, actual
action — with constants in `d, N_c, β, s, t, ε` only.**  Still M3
lattice-side; the continuum (M4/M5/Clay) untouched.

Plain language: **the infrared clustering bound of the strong-coupling
lattice theory is machine-checked end to end.**  For multiplicative
local observables with supports at touching-distance `≥ 2k`,

    ‖Z[FG]·Z − Z[F]·Z[G]‖ ≤ C·e^{−ε·k},

`C` explicit (`8|S||T|·y'/(1−Ky')·‖Z[F]‖·‖Z[G]‖`) and volume-free,
under high-temperature smallness depending only on the dimension and
the weight bounds.  The chain: the covariance identity (`Z = Ξ =
exp(K)` for all four deformed gases), the inclusion–exclusion
(supported on connecting clusters), the symmetrization (`(n+1)`
absorbed into a unit tilt), the per-layer pinning, and the
volume-uniform connecting decay.  Dividing by `Z² > 0` gives
`|⟨FG⟩−⟨F⟩⟨G⟩| ≤ C'·e^{−εk}` — exactly the `hIRbound` hypothesis of
`lattice_mass_gap_of_clustering_uniform` (M3's IR input).  The
remaining M3 inputs are the UV single-scale bound (§6.3, content not
yet in the repo) and the Wilson-loop/area-law route (T4).  All M3
lattice-side; M4/M5/Clay untouched.

## Scope statement (the honest line)

Everything above is **lattice, finite-volume, M3-side**.  None of it reduces
any M4/M5/Clay obstruction (continuum limit, OS/Wightman reconstruction,
continuum mass gap — open mathematics).  Distance to the Clay prize:
**~0% (<0.1%), unchanged.**
