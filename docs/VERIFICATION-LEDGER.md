# Verification ledger — release audit of the KP/Penrose campaign

**Date:** 2026-06-10 · **Commit range audited:** `360bf3d..a3343f1` (30 commits)
**Build:** `lake build YangMillsCore` — **8209 jobs, green.**
**Source scan:** zero literal `sorry`/`axiom` declarations in `YangMills/KP/`

No declaration depends on anything beyond Lean's three standard axioms.

## What these are (plain language, with references)

* **Target A (closed):** the Ursell/Mayer coefficient on complete graphs
  satisfies `d(n+1) = −n·d(n)`, hence `φ(K_{n+1}) = (−1)ⁿ·n!`; the n=1 Mayer
  identity `Ξ = exp(clusterSum)` follows unconditionally.  [Classical
  cluster-expansion combinatorics; see e.g. Friedli–Velenik, *Statistical
  Mechanics of Lattice Systems*, Ch. 5.]
* **Penrose tree-graph inequality (closed):** `|φ(X)| ≤ #spanning trees of
  the incompatibility graph` — O. Penrose, *Convergence of fugacity
  expansions for fluids and lattice gases*, J. Math. Phys. 4 (1963) /
  partition-scheme form 1967; proved here via the greedy BFS scheme with
  Boolean-interval fibers.
* **Tree counting (closed):** `treeCount (m+1) ≤ (m+1)^(m+1)` by injectivity
  of the greedy parent map — sufficient (with `(n+1)ⁿ ≤ eⁿ·n!`) for the KP
  bound; no Prüfer bijection required.
* **Target B (closed):** the Kotecký–Preiss per-size estimate
  `clusterWeight P n ≤ (∑‖z‖)·(e·A)ⁿ` and convergence of the Mayer series
  for `e·A < 1` — R. Kotecký & D. Preiss, *Cluster expansion for abstract
  polymer models*, Comm. Math. Phys. 103 (1986); proved here under the
  **uniform** smallness `e·max(a) < 1` (slightly stronger than sharp KP;
  refinable).
* **M3 bridge (conditional, proved):** geometric IR cluster bound + UV
  suppression ⟹ uniform exponential decay with one positive gap
  (Osterwalder–Seiler-type assembly; the IR/UV inputs remain explicit
  hypotheses pending the polymer representation and UV bound).

## Addendum (2026-06-10, autonomous overnight session): T3 closed

Additional headline results, each `#print axioms` =
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, core green at 8212 jobs:

```
'YangMills.integral_centerAct'                       (gauge measure centre-invariant)
'YangMills.integral_wilsonLoop_eq_zero'              (selection rule, matrix units, abstract)
'YangMills.integral_wilsonLoopSU_eq_zero'            (selection rule at genuine SU(n) Haar)
'YangMills.wilsonAction_centerAct'                   (exact centre symmetry of the Wilson action)
'YangMills.integral_centerAct_gibbs'                 (interacting Gibbs measure centre-invariant)
'YangMills.integral_wilsonLoopSU_gibbs_eq_zero'      (Z_n selection rule, interacting, any β)
```

Plain language: the centre `Z_n ⊂ SU(n)` acts on lattice gauge fields by
multiplying every positively-oriented edge by `ω = e^{2πi/n}`; the product
Haar measure is invariant (Haar), and the Wilson action is *exactly*
invariant because every plaquette crosses two edges forward and two backward
(net centre charge zero).  A Wilson loop of length `L` is an eigenfunction
with eigenvalue `ω^L`, so its expectation — free **or interacting, at any
coupling** — vanishes unless `n | L`.  This is the lattice N-ality selection
rule (centre symmetry; cf. 't Hooft's centre-symmetry analyses and standard
LGT texts, e.g. Montvay–Münster §3), now machine-checked end to end.
Loops here are positively-oriented edge lists; the signed-length
generalization is routine and noted in `docs/T3-LG6-PLAN.md`.

## Addendum 2 (2026-06-10, continued autonomous session): polymer rep. step 1

Headline results, each `#print axioms` = `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`:

```
'YangMills.boltzmann_eq_sum_plaquetteSets'           (exp(-βS) = Mayer sum over plaquette sets)
'YangMills.partitionFunction_eq_sum_plaquetteSets''  (Z as polymer-gas sum, UNCONDITIONAL for
                                                      bounded measurable energies)
'YangMills.abs_plaquetteWeight_le'                   (|f_p| ≤ e^{|β|B} − 1, KP smallness seed)
'YangMills.measurable_plaquetteHolonomy'             (holonomies measurable)
'YangMills.integrable_boltzmann'                     (Boltzmann weight integrable, bounded pe)
'YangMills.partitionFunction_pos''                   (Z > 0, integrability hypothesis ELIMINATED)
'YangMills.gibbsMeasure_isProbability''              (Gibbs probability, hypothesis ELIMINATED)
```

Plain language: the Gibbs weight expands as `∏_p (1 + f_p)` with Mayer
weights `f_p = e^{-βE_p} − 1`, turning the partition function into a gas of
plaquette sets with activities uniformly `≤ e^{|β|B} − 1` — the
high-temperature polymer representation (standard; e.g. Montvay–Münster,
Seiler, *Gauge Theories as a Problem of Constructive QFT*), step 1 of
connecting the verified KP convergence to the lattice Gibbs theory.  The
integrability hypotheses previously carried by `partitionFunction_pos` and
`gibbsMeasure_isProbability` are now discharged for bounded measurable
plaquette energies (e.g. `Re tr` on a compact group).

## Addendum 3 (2026-06-10, autonomous loop, final): observables + correlators

Each `#print axioms` = `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`,
core green at 8214 jobs:

```
'YangMills.norm_wilsonLoopSU_le'                     (|W| ≤ n: trace bound on SU(n))
'YangMills.measurable_wilsonLoopSU'                  (W measurable; SU(n) MeasurableMul₂/Inv
                                                      instances built componentwise)
'YangMills.integrable_wilsonLoopSU_gibbs'            (W integrable under Gibbs — the
                                                      selection-rule expectations are
                                                      well-defined integrals)
'YangMills.integral_wilsonLoopSU_mul_gibbs_eq_zero'  (CORRELATOR selection rule: two-loop
                                                      Gibbs correlators vanish unless
                                                      n | L+L', any coupling)
```

Status of the M3 campaign after this run: T1 ✓, T2 (full KP convergence) ✓,
T3 (selection rules, free + interacting + correlator, with integrability) ✓,
polymer representation step 1 ✓ with three integrability hypotheses
eliminated.  Remaining: polymer step 2 (connected grouping + independence
factorization of the product measure — next campaign, multi-session),
UV bound, T4.  M4/M5: class C, open mathematics.

## Addendum 4 (2026-06-10, continued loop): the lattice gas, end to end

Each `#print axioms` = `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`:

```
'YangMills.plaquetteWeight_congr' / 'prod_plaquetteWeight_congr'   (locality)
'YangMills.integral_mul_of_disjoint_deps'                          (two-block independence,
                                                                    product measures, no hypotheses)
'YangMills.integral_prod_plaquetteWeight_mul_of_disjoint'          (gauge-level factorization)

'YangMills.latticeClusterSum_summable'                             (LATTICE MAYER SERIES CONVERGES)

'YangMills.abs_partitionFunction_sub_one_le'                       (|Z−1| ≤ (e^{|β|B})^{#P} − 1)
'YangMills.partitionFunction_pos_of_small'                         (quantitative Z > 0)
```

Plain language: the cluster expansion of finite-volume SU(N) lattice gauge
theory at small coupling is now machine-checked from the Boltzmann factor to
absolute convergence with explicit constants, with the partition function
quantitatively pinned near 1.  Thresholds are volume-dependent; the
volume-uniform refinement (connected polymers, lattice-animal entropy) is
the scoped remaining step.  All M3 lattice-side; M4/M5/Clay untouched.

## Addendum 5 (2026-06-10, continued loop): VOLUME-UNIFORMITY

The entropy campaign (`ConnectedEntropy.lean`), opened and **closed** in one
session.  Each `#print axioms` = `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`:

                                                                   ≤ (16d+1)^{2n} animals of size n+1
                                                                   through a point, volume-free)

```

Plain language: connected plaquette sets are ranges of lazy closed walks
(greedy growth via splicing), walks are counted by the degree bound `16d`,
so there are at most `(16d+1)^{2n}` connected polymers of size `n+1` through
any plaquette — **independent of the lattice volume** (standard
lattice-animal counting; cf. Friedli–Velenik Ch. 5/6, Simon, *The
Statistical Mechanics of Lattice Gases*).  Consequently the Kotecký–Preiss
criterion for the connected lattice gas holds under smallness conditions on
`β` depending **only on the dimension** — the volume-dependence caveat of
addendum 4 is **eliminated at the criterion level**.

~~Honest remaining caveat: composing this with our formalized KP
*convergence* theorem still passes through the uniform bound `a(c) ≤ A`~~
**RESOLVED — see addendum 6.**

## Addendum 6 (2026-06-10, the sharp-KP completion) — VOLUME-UNIFORM
CONVERGENCE, the campaign endpoint

**Build:** `lake build YangMillsCore` — 8223 jobs, green, at `708d318`.

```

Plain language: the **sharp (weight-respecting) Kotecký–Preiss bound is
fully machine-checked** — `∑_n (truncated pinned cluster sums) ≤
‖z(c)‖·e^{a(c)}` under the bare criterion, with NO uniform majorant of
the weights and NO geometric smallness hypothesis (FV Thm 5.4-level,
via the shell decomposition of `SharpShell.lean`: Penrose domination →
rooted depth-`D` tree-sums → block factorization priced by the
multinomial → the Borel-sum recursion `B_{D+1} ≤ exp(∑ ‖z‖·B_D)` →
induction to the `kpMajorant` → `e^{a(c)}`).  Composed with the
volume-uniform criterion (addendum 5), the Mayer cluster series of the
connected lattice polymer gas **converges absolutely under β-smallness
depending only on the dimension** — the `hA` caveat of addendum 5 is
eliminated; nothing in the convergence hypotheses references the
lattice volume.  All M3 lattice-side; M4/M5/Clay untouched.

## Addendum 7 (2026-06-10, the Mayer–Ursell inversion) — THE
FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CLUSTER EXPANSIONS

**Build:** `lake build YangMillsCore` — green at `b8dd5ee`.
**Source scan:** zero `sorry`/`axiom` in `YangMills/KP/` (unchanged).

Oracle outputs (verbatim, the headline chain of

'YangMills.KP.partition_eq_exp_clusterSum_of_kp'      [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
```

Plain language: **`Ξ = exp(clusterSum)` is fully machine-checked** —
for every finite polymer system with absolutely convergent cluster
series, and outright under the bare KP criterion (the sharp theory of
addendum 6 supplies the convergence).  This was the "months-long crux"
recorded in `Expansion.lean`'s header (E3, the deferred Mayer–Ursell
inversion).  The proof: the partition identity (sums of block-Ursell
products over all `Finpartition`s = the compatibility indicator,
via component-partition fibrations of the alternating subgraph sums),
the π-collapse to ordered partitions, the exact function-space split,
the multinomial count `#ordp(m)·∏mᵢ! = N!`, the injective collapse to
admissible sets, and the analytic shell (power Fubini, the master
sigma-sum, size regrouping with finite layers, tail-kill).  This
unlocks the cluster-correlation chain (`docs/CLUSTER-CORRELATION-PLAN.md`
Half B): correlators as differences of `log Ξ`-type quantities are now
expressible through cluster sums with the proved volume-uniform decay
engine (Half A).  All M3 lattice-side; M4/M5/Clay untouched.

## Addendum 8 (2026-06-11, the connecting decay + the `Z = Ξ` gate)

**Build:** `lake build YangMillsCore` — green at `6bba786` (8227 jobs).

'YangMills.partitionFunction_eq_exp_clusterSum'       [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
```

Plain language: two campaign endpoints.  (1) **The volume-uniform IR
decay mechanism** (`connecting_cluster_decay`,
`L1_GibbsMeasure/ClusterGeometry.lean`): the total pinned cluster sum
over clusters through `p` that also touch `q` is bounded by
`exp(−ε·d(p,q)/2)·x/(1−(16d+1)²x)` — every constant depends only on
`d, B, β, t, ε`.  (2) **The measure-side identification**
(`partitionFunction_eq_partition`,
`L1_GibbsMeasure/PolymerRepresentation.lean`): the Wilson-action
partition function equals the polymer-gas partition function of the
connected lattice gas — proved by the component bijection
(`plaqComponents`: parts of the reachability partition of the
touching graph; `componentFamily`: their instance-free polymer lift),
with values matched by the polymer factorization integral.  Composed
with addendum 7: **`Z = exp(clusterSum)` at high temperature**, hence
`Z ≠ 0`, with volume-uniform constants.  What remains for the IR
hypothesis of `lattice_mass_gap_of_clustering_uniform`: B2 (the
covariance identity for deformed gases) + B4 (assembly).  All M3
lattice-side; M4/M5/Clay untouched.

Plain language: the entire `Z = Ξ = exp(K)` chain now holds for
**arbitrary bounded measurable local weight families**, volume-uniformly
(`WeightedGas.lean` + `PolymerRepresentation.lean`).  Multiplicative
local observables `∏_{p∈T}(1+g_p)` absorb into deformed weights, the
four-gas inclusion–exclusion `K_{FG}+K−K_F−K_G` cancels termwise off
clusters connecting the two regions, and the endpoint is

    Z[FG]·Z = Z[F]·Z[G]·exp(connecting cluster sum)

— **the covariance identity**, division-free, with all constants
depending only on `d`, the weight bounds, and `t`.  Remaining for the
IR side of M3: bound the connecting sum by the (already proved,
Wilson-gas) exponential decay mechanism transported to the weighted
gas, and assemble `hIRbound`.  All M3 lattice-side; M4/M5/Clay
untouched.

'YangMills.gibbs_truncated_correlation_bound'         [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
```

The final form (`gibbs_truncated_correlation_bound`): for observables
`O_R = ∏_{p∈R}(1+g_p)` over disjoint supports `S, T` at
touching-distance `≥ 2k`, in genuine Gibbs integrals over the Wilson
Boltzmann weight,

    |∫O_S·O_T·e^{−βS}·Z − ∫O_S·e^{−βS}·∫O_T·e^{−βS}| ≤ C·e^{−ε·k},

real absolute values, `C` explicit and volume-free.  Divide by
`Z² > 0` (`partitionFunction_pos'`) for the normalized covariance.

And the M3 adapter (`lattice_mass_gap_of_exp_clustering_uniform`,
`Paper/ClusteringToGap.lean`, oracle clean): the uniform lattice mass
gap consuming the IR bound in exactly this `e^{−εk}` shape
(`r := e^{−ε}`).  **The IR hypothesis of the strong-coupling lattice
mass gap is now fed by a theorem; the only hypothesis-carried input
left in the M3 assembly is the §6.3 single-scale UV bound (the
Balaban input, deliberately carried — never an axiom).**

And the T4 shortcut (`two_plaquette_correlator_bound`,
`L1_GibbsMeasure/TwoPlaquetteCorrelator.lean`, oracle clean at
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`): the connected
two-plaquette correlator of ANY bounded measurable holonomy
observable decays exponentially in the touching-distance at small
`β`, volume-free — the `kp_cluster_decay`-shaped endpoint of
`PETER_WEYL_ROADMAP.md` Layer 4, reached WITHOUT Peter–Weyl, Schur
orthogonality, or the Osterwalder–Seiler character expansion (those
layers were routes to polymer bounds the weighted-Mayer campaign
produced directly).  Peter–Weyl remains the route for the
area-law/Wilson-loop form.

And the normalized finale
(`two_plaquette_correlator_bound_normalized`, oracle clean): dividing
by `Z² > 0` cancels the partition function from the constant —

    |⟨f_p·f_q⟩ − ⟨f_p⟩·⟨f_q⟩| ≤ (8·M·(1+s)²/s²)·e^{−ε·k},

the genuine Gibbs covariance of bounded local holonomy observables,
with the constant depending only on `d, β, B, s, t, ε` — independent
of the lattice volume AND of `Z`.  **Exponential clustering of the
lattice gauge theory's two-point functions at small coupling is
machine-checked end to end.**

Non-vacuity (adversarial audit, `clustering_window_nonempty`, oracle
clean): at `t = ε = 1` the three smallness hypotheses are
simultaneously satisfiable for every dimension, with explicit
`δ₀(d) = ((K²+64d+8)·e³)⁻¹ > 0`; the `(β, s)`-window is nonempty —
the clustering theorems are not vacuous.

And the SU(N) capstone (`sun_two_plaquette_correlator_bound`, oracle
clean at `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`): the clustering
bound instantiated at the **genuine** Yang–Mills data — the gauge
group `SU(N_c)`, the Haar probability measure `sunHaarProb`, the
Wilson plaquette energy `Re tr U` (bounded by `N_c`).  **Exponential
clustering of two-point functions for the SU(N) Wilson lattice gauge
theory at strong coupling — actual group, actual measure, actual
action — with constants in `d, N_c, β, s, t, ε` only.**  Still M3
lattice-side; the continuum (M4/M5/Clay) untouched.

With its own non-vacuity witness
(`sun_clustering_window_nonempty`, oracle clean): for every `d, N_c`
an EXPLICIT coupling window `β₀ = log(1+δ₁/4)/N_c > 0` and scaling
`s = δ₁/4` (with `δ₁ = min(δ₀(d), 1)`) in which every hypothesis of
the SU(N) capstone holds, at `t = ε = 1`, for every separation.

Plain language: **the infrared clustering bound of the strong-coupling
lattice theory is machine-checked end to end.**  For multiplicative
local observables with supports at touching-distance `≥ 2k`,

    ‖Z[FG]·Z − Z[F]·Z[G]‖ ≤ C·e^{−ε·k},

`C` explicit (`8|S||T|·y'/(1−Ky')·‖Z[F]‖·‖Z[G]‖`) and volume-free,
under high-temperature smallness depending only on the dimension and
the weight bounds.  The chain: the covariance identity (`Z = Ξ =
exp(K)` for all four deformed gases), the inclusion–exclusion
(supported on connecting clusters), the symmetrization (`(n+1)`
absorbed into a unit tilt), the per-layer pinning, and the
volume-uniform connecting decay.  Dividing by `Z² > 0` gives
`|⟨FG⟩−⟨F⟩⟨G⟩| ≤ C'·e^{−εk}` — exactly the `hIRbound` hypothesis of
`lattice_mass_gap_of_clustering_uniform` (M3's IR input).  The
remaining M3 inputs are the UV single-scale bound (§6.3, content not
yet in the repo) and the Wilson-loop/area-law route (T4).  All M3
lattice-side; M4/M5/Clay untouched.

Content (`docs/AREA-LAW-PLAN.md` for the design):

* **AL1+AL2** (`L0_Lattice/ChainComplex.lean`): the lattice chain
  complex over an arbitrary `CommRing R` — `∂₁∘∂₂ = 0` from the
  `FiniteLatticeGeometry` square-closure axioms; `chainArea` as the
  minimal spanning-surface size with its defining bound, attainment,
  and closedness of spannable chains.  `R := ℤ` is the integral
  theory, `R := ZMod N_c` the `N`-ality theory the Haar selection
  rule feeds.
* **AL3** — closed by audit: `sunHaarProb_fundMonomial_integral_zero`
  (banked) IS the per-edge balance criterion.
* **AL4 substrate + expansion** (`EdgeFactorization.lean`,
  `WilsonLoopExpansion.lean`): the `ℂ`-valued two-block independence
  factorization, the single-coordinate marginalization (the per-edge
  integration step), and the integral-level binomial expansion
  `∫ W·∏(1+f_p) = ∑_S ∫ W·∏_{p∈S} f_p`.
* **AL5 interface**: a spanning chain supported in `S` bounds the
  (`N`-ality) area by `|S|`.

Open in the campaign: the per-edge monomial bookkeeping connecting a
non-vanishing expansion term to a balanced `ZMod N_c` chain (the
AL4/AL5 join), then AL6 (entropy + tail + non-vacuity window).  All
M3 lattice-side; M4/M5/Clay untouched.

`N_c`-unbalanced signed traversal count** — in particular every open
line and every fundamental loop traversing some edge exactly once.

trace → closed vertex sequences (`trace_wilsonLine_eq_sum_decorated`,
itself via the `Fin`-indexed path expansion and the entry decoration
`posToFun_val_apply`: forward traversal = entry, backward = conjugated
transposed entry by unitarity) → per-edge fiber grouping
(`prod_comp_eq_prod_fiber`) → one-unbalanced-edge kill
(`integral_positionProduct_eq_zero`) → `Finset`-indexed `N`-ality
selection rule (`sunHaarProb_decoratedEntryProduct_integral_zero`).
Plus `loopChain` (TE-2) feeding the `ZMod N_c` chain complex for the
remaining DB-2/J-3 join (`docs/AREA-LAW-PLAN.md` §4).  All M3
lattice-side; M4/M5/Clay untouched.

Content: the β=0 `N`-ality selection rule now holds for PRODUCTS of
Wilson-line traces with the hypothesis in CHAIN form — a product
survives Haar integration only if `∑ⱼ loopChain (L j) = 0` over
`ZMod N_c` at every positive edge
(`integral_prod_trace_wilsonLine_eq_zero_of_sum_loopChain_ne_zero`);
plaquette Wilson lists supply the antisymmetrized boundary columns
(`sum_mul_loopChain_plaquette_list_eq_chainBoundary₂A`), and the
`N`-ality area against that boundary has its spanning bound
(`chainAreaA_le_card_of_support_subset`).  For the strong-coupling
family `loop C :: plaquette-loops-of-S`, the survival condition is
verbatim the chain equation; what remains of the area law is the
expansion-term formalization (the σ-sign bookkeeping) and the AL6
entropy/tail assembly (banked patterns).  All M3 lattice-side;
M4/M5/Clay untouched.

The last line is the **area-law join**: if the β=0 Haar expectation
of a Wilson loop times `m` σ-signed plaquette traces does not vanish,
the loop's `N`-ality area (`chainAreaA` of its `loopChain`, over
`ZMod N_c`) is at most `m`.  Every surviving term of the
strong-coupling expansion spans a discrete surface — machine-checked,
unconditional, no sorry, no axioms beyond the standard three.  The
spanning-surface lower bound (AL5, the campaign's single
high-novelty item) is hereby DISCHARGED; only AL6's quantitative
entropy/tail assembly (banked patterns) separates the repo from
`|⟨W_C⟩| ≤ C₀·r^{Area}`.

**Content (the volume-uniform campaign's opening brick,
`docs/AREA-LAW-VU-PLAN.md` V0-1):** the β = 0 gauge measure is the
per-positive-edge product measure, so observables with disjoint
positive-edge supports are independent.  `DependsOnPos` formalizes
"reads only the coordinates in `S`" (with a `mono`/`mul`/`finset_prod`
calculus); `dependsOnPos_comp_wilsonLine` certifies in one stroke that
every post-composed Wilson-line observable `φ(W_es)` — the loop trace,
linearized activities, and the exact `exp` activities alike — depends
only on `edgeSupport es`; `integral_mul_of_disjoint_pos_deps`
transports the banked two-block factorization along
`gaugeConfigMEquiv`; and `integral_mul_prod_of_disjoint_support` /
`integral_wilson_obs_mul_prod_split` give the campaign shape: a loop
observable times any activities supported away from the loop
factorizes.  This is the mechanism by which far-from-the-loop polymer
components will cancel against `Z` (V1).  All M3 lattice-side.

'YangMills.dependsOnPos_plaquette_obs''                [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
```

The signed/positive support seam feared in the plan DISSOLVED:
`PolymerExpansion.plaquetteSupport` was already positive-edge-level,
and `plaquettePosSupport_eq` is an outright Finset equality — so
`ClusterGeometry`'s component combinatorics
(`plaqComponents_support_disjoint`, `_not_touching`) and V0-1's
independence calculus now speak about the same sets.  Next: the
regrouping identity (split `S` by components touching the loop).

**Addendum 17c (same day, V0-2 closed — V0 COMPLETE).**  Build green

'YangMills.farLoop_disjoint_edgeSupport'               [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
```

**The component regrouping:** for any plaquette activities `f_p` local
to their support, every powerset term of the loop-tagged expansion
factorizes as
`∫ φ(W_C)·∏_{p∈S} f_p = (∫ φ(W_C)·∏_{nearLoop es S} f_p)·(∫ ∏_{S∖nearLoop} f_p)`
— `nearLoop` collects the `plaqComponents` of `S` touching the loop's
edge support; far components are support-disjoint from both the loop
and the near block (`plaqComponents_support_disjoint` + the V0-1
independence).  V0 of `docs/AREA-LAW-VU-PLAN.md` is COMPLETE; the
campaign's center of mass (V1, the `Z`-ratio cancellation) is next.

```

Summing the far factor of the V0 regrouping over all far subsets
reconstitutes the RESTRICTED partition function:
`∑_{T⊆F} ∫ ∏_{p∈T} f_p = ∫ ∏_{p∈F}(1+f_p)` — the `Z_{F}` object the
V1 ratio cancellation divides against.  Remaining in V1: the fiber
bijection `S ↔ (S₀, T)` (needs `plaqComponents` stability under
support-disjoint unions — the campaign's hard graph brick) and the
`Z`-ratio bound via the cluster expansion.

```

The campaign's hard graph brick is DISCHARGED:
`nearLoop es (S₀ ∪ T) = S₀` for pinned `S₀` and far `T` — adjoining
far plaquettes never changes the near part.  Proved via the
reachability characterization of `nearLoop`, walk confinement, and
witness lifting along the inclusion hom.  Remaining in V1-b: only the
`Finset.sum_nbij'` fiber reindexing (`nearLoop_idem` + bookkeeping);
then V1-c, the `Z`-ratio bound.

**Addendum 17f (same day, `nearLoop` idempotence).**  Build green

```

A walk to a loop-touching plaquette has all its vertices near, so it
descends into the near part's own touching graph; hence
`nearLoop es (nearLoop es S) = nearLoop es S` — the forward fiber map
lands in the pinned sets.  V1-b now lacks only the `sum_nbij'`
reindexing bookkeeping.

**The fiber decomposition of the loop-tagged powerset expansion:**

    ∑_{S ⊆ P} g(S) = ∑_{S₀ pinned} ∑_{T ⊆ farRegion(S₀)} g(S₀ ∪ T)

— every subset splits uniquely as a pinned near part plus an arbitrary
far subset (`sum_nbij'` with the V1-b stability/idempotence theorems
as the two inverse laws).  **V1-b is COMPLETE.**  Combined with the V0
regrouping and the V1-a far resummation, the numerator now has the
campaign's target shape
`∑_{S₀ pinned} (∫ φ(W_C)·∏_{S₀} f) · Z_{farRegion(S₀)}`
(assembly + the `Z`-ratio bound = V1-c, the campaign's last analytic
stretch).

**The campaign's structural identity is machine-checked:** for any
plaquette activities `f_p` local to their support (with the two
natural integrability families),

    ∫ φ(W_C)·∏_{p∈P}(1+f_p)
        = ∑_{S₀ pinned} (∫ φ(W_C)·∏_{p∈S₀} f_p) · Z_{farRegion(S₀)}

— the unnormalized loop expectation is a PINNED sum, each term
carrying the restricted partition function of its far region.  One
proof chains all of V0/V1-a/V1-b: pointwise binomial →
`integral_finset_sum` → the fiber reindexing → per-fiber
support-disjoint factorization → the far resummation.  Compiled first
try on the banked bricks.  What remains of V1 is purely analytic: the
volume-free bound on `Z_{farRegion(S₀)}/Z` via the difference of
cluster sums (clusters meeting the loop's neighbourhood) and the
pinned KP tail.  All M3 lattice-side; M4/M5/Clay untouched.

`PolymerSystem.restrict P Λ` (polymers = `↥Λ`, inherited structure)
with `partition P Λ = partition (P.restrict Λ) univ` — the
volume-restricted Mayer inversion now reduces to the banked
univ-version applied to the restricted system.  Remaining in R1: the
`KPCriterion` transfer; then R2 (the cluster-sum difference) and R3
(the restricted lattice gate).

**Addendum 17j (same day, R1 COMPLETE — the volume-restricted Mayer
inversion).**  Build green (8237 jobs), oracle clean:

```

Under the ambient KP criterion, EVERY finite-volume partition function
is the exponential of its restricted system's cluster sum:
`partition P Λ = exp(clusterSum (P.restrict Λ))` — so a ratio of
partition functions over two volumes is the exponential of a
difference of cluster sums.  Remaining: R2 (bound that difference by
the pinned tail over the small region) and R3 (the restricted lattice
gate `∫∏_F(1+f) = partition gas (polymersIn F)`).

**Addendum 17k (same day, R2 difference identity + exponent bound).**

```

Under the KP criterion the cluster sums of the full and restricted
systems differ exactly by the tuple sums MEETING `Λᶜ`
(`clusterSum_sub_restrict`), and that difference is bounded in norm by
the off-region weight tail (`norm_clusterSum_sub_restrict_le`):
**`‖log(Z_Λ/Z)‖ ≤ ∑'_n offRegionClusterWeight P Λ n`.**  Remaining in
R2: render the right side volume-free via the swap-reindex union bound
(`ursell_comp_equiv`) and the tilted pinned tails; then R3.

— every escaping tuple is charged to a pinned polymer OUTSIDE `Λ` by
swapping its escaping index to position 0 (`ursell` is
permutation-invariant) and fibering.  The `Z`-ratio exponent is now a
sum over `Λᶜ`-pinned weights up to the `(n+1)` factor, which the
tilted pinned tails absorb (R2(b4), the last analytic step of R2).

**The abstract `Z`-ratio theory is DONE.**  Under the `e^t`-tilted KP
criterion (`KPCriterion (P.scaleActivity (exp t)) a` — exactly the
form the lattice gas verifies),

    ‖log(Z_Λ / Z)‖ = ‖clusterSum P − clusterSum (P.restrict Λ)‖
        ≤ ∑'_n offRegionClusterWeight P Λ n
        ≤ t⁻¹ · ∑_{c ∉ Λ} e^t · ‖z(c)‖ · e^{a(c)}

— a sum over the polymers OUTSIDE `Λ` only: volume-free when `Λᶜ` is
the loop's neighbourhood.  Chained: the restricted Mayer inversion
(R1), the difference identity (R2a), the off-region majorant (R2b1–2),
the swap-reindex union bound (R2b3), the scalar tilt absorbing `(n+1)`
(R2b4).  Remaining in V1: R3, the restricted lattice gate.

The truncation device's substrate: `truncWeight w F = w·1_F` with the
pointwise identity `∏_F(1+w) = ∏_univ(1+w·1_F)`, inherited
`IsLocalWeight`/measurability/bound, and the truncated gas's
activities — ZERO off the `F`-polymers, EQUAL to the original gas's on
them.  Remaining in R3: the assembly chain (banked weighted gate at
`truncWeight` + `partition_eq_of_activity_eq_zero` + the activity
congruence) into `Z_F = partition (gas w) (polymersIn F)`.

'YangMills.restricted_weightedPartition_eq_partition'  [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]

**`∫ ∏_{p∈F}(1+w_p) = Ξ_{gas(w)}(polymersIn F)`** — the
region-restricted lattice partition function IS the polymer partition
function over the `F`-polymers of the ORIGINAL gas, by the truncation
device (truncate, apply the banked 3.2M-heartbeat gate unchanged, drop
the vanished activities, restore the originals).  **R1 + R2 + R3: the
`Z`-ratio machinery of V1 is COMPLETE** — every restricted `Z_F` is an
`exp(clusterSum)` (R1), the log-ratio is a difference of cluster sums
(R2a), bounded volume-free by the `Λᶜ`-pinned tilted tails (R2b).
Remaining to close V1 outright: the lattice glue (instantiate at
`Λ := polymersIn (farRegion es S₀)` with the banked tilted KP
criterion) and the neighbourhood-geometry count.  All M3 lattice-side.

'YangMills.restricted_partition_log_ratio_bound'       [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
```

**The `Z`-ratio cancellation is assembled at the lattice.**  For the
weighted gas at strong coupling (the banked volume-uniform window in
`d, δ, t, ε`), for EVERY plaquette region `F`:

    Z_F = exp(clusterSum(gas|_{polymersIn F}))   and
    ‖log Z − log Z_F‖ ≤ ∑_{c ⊄ F} e·‖z(c)‖·e^{t·|c|}

— the log-ratio of the full and region-restricted partition functions
is bounded by a sum over the polymers NOT contained in `F` alone.
Instantiated at `F := farRegion es S₀`, the right side runs over
polymers meeting the loop's neighbourhood — the volume-free quantity
the campaign was built to reach.  What remains of V1 is bookkeeping
(the neighbourhood polymer count via `ConnectedEntropy`); V2 (the
pinned area tail) then closes the campaign.  All M3 lattice-side;

**V1 — THE `Z`-RATIO CANCELLATION, THE CAMPAIGN'S CENTER OF MASS, IS
COMPLETE.**  The exponent sum is bounded by
`#Fᶜ · e·(δe^t)/(1−(16d+1)²·δe^t)` — every escaping polymer charged to
a plaquette outside `F` it contains, the through-plaquette sums
volume-uniform by the banked lattice-animal entropy
(`sum_connectedPolymers_through_le`).  Chained with Addendum 17p:

    ‖log(Z/Z_{farRegion(S₀)})‖ ≤ #(P ∖ farRegion(S₀)) · C(d, δ, t)

— the log-ratio is linear in the size of the loop's neighbourhood,
with constants in `d, δ, t` only.  V0 + V1 are COMPLETE; V2 (the
pinned area tail: the N-ality kill + pinned entropy, both mechanisms
already proved in the area-law campaigns) closes the volume-uniform
area law.  All M3 lattice-side; M4/M5/Clay untouched.

          · exp((#loopSupp·4d + #S₀·16d)·K(d,δ,t))

— the kill annihilates every sub-area pinned term, each survivor
carries its geometric weight times a loop-neighbourhood exponential,
and `Z` cancelled against the far factors through the restricted
cluster expansion (the entire V0+V1 machinery executing in one
statement).  Integrability of the finite products is carried as two
explicit hypothesis families (standard, to be discharged at
instantiation).  Remaining for the campaign headline (V2-3c): pull
`r^{Area}` out of the pinned sum and resum the loop-anchored component
gas into the perimeter prefactor `e^{c·|C|}`.  All M3 lattice-side;

`p ∈ S₀ = nearLoop` lands `p` in a touching component `c'`, and

via (i) the per-pinned-set factorization `σ^{#S₀} = ∏_{c ∈

sets landing inside the powerset of loop-touching admissible polymers
(nonemptiness + connectedness banked in V0; touching from the new
lemma).  Elementary throughout — no KP, no measure theory.  Remaining

**The volume-uniform area law is machine-checked.**  For the

`S(σ) = σ/(1−(16d+1)²σ)` — **area-law decay with a perimeter-only
prefactor, every constant volume-free**: the bound holds on every
finite lattice uniformly.  The chain: the loop-tagged expansion (V0),
the restricted-`Z` cancellation (V1), the N-ality kill + pinned
dichotomy (V2-2/3a), the `Z`-ratio exponentials (3b′), the
`√ρ` area split (`sum_ite_pow_le`), and the pinned gas resummation
(17s) exponentiated by `prod_one_add_le_exp_sum` and charged to the
loop by `loopTouching_polymer_sum_le` (the loop-touching plaquette set
is exactly `(farRegion es ∅)ᶜ`, so the V2-1 count gives
`#loopSupp·4d`).

**Non-vacuity audit:** the hypothesis window is jointly satisfiable
for every `d, N_c` — e.g. `d=4, N_c=2, t=1, ε=0, δ=10⁻¹⁰, σ=2·10⁻⁴`
checks `hr`, `hsmall`, `hrσ`, `hρσ` simultaneously (binding constraint
`(16d+1)²σ < 1`; `δ` shrinks to fit `σ²`).  The conclusion is
non-trivial: `σ^{Area}` decays exponentially in the area against a

expansion `measurable_trace_wilsonLine`) and uniformly bounded
(`norm_trace_wilsonLine_le` through finite products — no smallness
needed, any `c, c'`), hence integrable on the Haar probability space
(`Integrable.bdd_mul`).  **The volume-uniform area law now carries NO
hypothesis families** — every remaining hypothesis is an explicit,
jointly satisfiable smallness/geometry condition (the 17t witness).

```

**V4** (`docs/AREA-LAW-VU-PLAN.md`) lifts the volume-uniform area law
from the linearized factor `∏(1+f_p)` to the TRUE Wilson Boltzmann
factor `∏ exp(z_p)`.  Key observation: at the conjugate pair
`c' = conj c` the exponent `z_p = 2·Re(c_p · tr H_p)` is REAL, so
`exp(z_p) = 1 + (exp(z_p) − 1)` is the linearized form with the real
activity `expReActivity := exp(2 Re(c · tr H)) − 1`.  The generic VU
pipeline (loop-tagged expansion + restricted `Z` cancellation) is
agnostic to the activity; only the per-pinned dichotomy must be
re-derived.  This addendum closes the activity interface (V4-0):
`isLocalWeight_expReActivity` (locality, via the banked reActivity
locality after a beta-reducing ascription — house note: an
`IsLocalWeight` result applied at `p A A'` is a beta-redex `rw` won't
see; ascribe the reduced equality to a `have`),
`measurable_expReActivity` (`Real.measurable_exp.comp` the banked
measurable reActivity), `expReActivity_bound`
(`|exp w − 1| ≤ exp(2δN_c) − 1` for `|w| ≤ 2δN_c`, by the elementary
AM–GM `2 ≤ e^B + e^{−B}`), and `exp_conjPair_eq_cast` (the ℂ factor
`exp(z_p)` IS the cast of the real `1 + expReActivity`, via
`Complex.add_conj` + `Complex.ofReal_exp`).  REMAINING: V4-1 (the
pinned-set exp dichotomy — the N-ality kill for `∏_{S₀}(exp z − 1)`,

`Fintype ι`, via the banked complex Pi-Cauchy product `tsum_pi_prod'`
with the succ-shifted summands (summability by
`Summable.comp_injective (add_left_injective 1)`).  The SHIFT is the
design choice: every term has exponent `m_i+1 ≥ 1`, so when this is
instantiated at `ι = ↥S₀` every contributing monomial occupies EXACTLY
`S₀` — the N-ality kill (`norm_integral_exp_term_le`) then fires
uniformly when `Area > #S₀`, with no support bookkeeping.  REMAINING in
V4-1: the ∫↔∑' swap over the pinned product (`integral_tsum_of_bounded`)
+ the per-term kill + the survivor resummation to `(e^{2δN_c}−1)^{#S₀}`

The exp analog of `norm_integral_pinned_term_le` — the single piece

— the N-ality KILL below the area, the geometric `(e^{2δN_c}−1)^{#S₀}`
survivor bound above it.  Route (mirrors `finite_volume_area_law_exp`
but pinned to `S₀` over the subtype `↥S₀`): the shifted exp-product
expansion `prod_exp_sub_one_eq_tsum_prod_pow_succ` (every exponent
`m_q+1 ≥ 1`) → `Finset.prod_coe_sort` to cross the `S₀`↔`↥S₀` seam →
the `∫↔∑'` swap `integral_tsum_of_bounded` (dominated by
`summable_prod_pow_succ_div_factorial`) → per-multiplicity
`norm_integral_exp_term_le` at the EXTENDED multiplicity
`ext m p = if p∈S₀ then m⟨p⟩+1 else 0` (whose support is EXACTLY `S₀`,
so the kill condition `Area ≤ #supp` becomes the uniform `Area ≤ #S₀`)
→ survivor resummation `tsum_prod_pow_succ_div_factorial`
(`= (e^{2δN_c}−1)^{card ↥S₀}`, `Fintype.card_coe`).  Supporting engine

`prod_exp_sub_one_eq_tsum_prod_pow_succ`,

House notes: the full-P↔subtype multiplicity bridge is
`prod_filter_mul_prod_filter_not (·∈S₀)` + `prod_attach` + `simp [q.2]`
(off-S₀ factors are `z^0/0! = 1`); the zero-area branch collapses via
`tsum_congr (fun m => if_neg hA)` + `tsum_zero`.  REMAINING: V4-2 — the
headline re-composition (the exp analogs of
`norm_normalized_wilson_loop_le_pinned_sum` and

## Addendum 18d (2026-06-12, **V4 CLOSED — THE EXACT-ACTIVITY
VOLUME-UNIFORM AREA LAW** `normalized_exp_wilson_loop_area_law`)

**Build:** green (8238 jobs).  Oracle outputs (verbatim,

```

The volume-uniform area law now holds for the **TRUE Wilson
Boltzmann factor** `∏ exp(z_p)` (not just the linearized `∏(1+f_p)`).
For the conjugate-pair exponent `z_p = c_p·tr H_p + conj(c_p)·conj tr H_p
= 2 Re(c_p·tr H_p)` (`‖c_p‖ ≤ δ`) in the banked strong-coupling
window, and any rate `σ ∈ [0,1]` with `(16d+1)²σ < 1` and
`(e^{2δN_c}−1)·e^{16d·K} ≤ σ²`:

    ‖(∫ tr(W_C)·∏_p exp(z_p)) / Z‖
      ≤ N_c·e^{#loopSupp·4d·K}·σ^{Area(C)}·e^{#loopSupp·4d·S(σ)}

with `K = e·((e^{2δN_c}−1)e^t)/(1−(16d+1)²(e^{2δN_c}−1)e^t)` and
`S(σ) = σ/(1−(16d+1)²σ)` — area decay, perimeter prefactor, every
constant volume-free, `Z` cancelled through the restricted cluster
expansion.  The composition exactly mirrors the linearized headline
`normalized_wilson_loop_area_law` with the SINGLE substitution
`2δN_c ↦ e^{2δN_c}−1` (the bound on `expReActivity`): the generic V0/V1
machinery (loop-tagged expansion, restricted-`Z` gate) is
activity-agnostic, so only the per-pinned dichotomy changed.
`norm_normalized_exp_wilson_loop_le_pinned_sum` runs the `Z`-ratio
cancellation at `w := expReActivity` (gate via the V4-0 interface,
numerator via V4-2(a), far factor via
`integral_exp_conjPair_prod_eq_cast`), and the headline chains it with
the abstract `sum_pinned_dichotomy_le` at `ρ₀ := e^{2δN_c}−1`.

**NO integrability hypothesis families** — discharged internally by the
banked exact-activity integrability lemmas; every remaining hypothesis
is an explicit, jointly satisfiable smallness/geometry condition (for
every `d, N_c`, take `δ` small: `e^{2δN_c}−1 → 0`, so `hr/hsmall/hrσ/hρσ`
hold simultaneously with e.g. `σ = 2·10⁻⁴`).  **THE V4 CAMPAIGN IS

```

```

The opening brick of the UV campaign (`docs/UV-SINGLE-SCALE-PLAN.md`).
It restates the SOLE carried M3 hypothesis at the renormalization-group
level: the covariance-level `hUV : ∀ t, |covUV t| ≤ C₂·e^{−c₀t}` is
reduced to the SHARP per-scale contraction

    ∀ t k, |R_{t,k}| ≤ (C₂·e^{−c₀t})·rᵏ        (0 ≤ r < 1)

with `covUV t = ∑_{k<n(t)} R_{t,k}` — exactly the form Balaban's
single-scale stability (Lemma 6.2) supplies.  Proof: the banked,
unconditional `Paper.uv_geometric_summation` (§6.3) collapses the scale
sum to the constant `C₂·(1−r)⁻¹`, recovering the `hUV` shape, and the
banked `lattice_mass_gap_of_exp_clustering_uniform` then delivers the
single strictly-positive gap `∃ gap > 0, ∀ t, |cov t| ≤
(C₁+C₂(1−r)⁻¹)·e^{−gap·t}`.  Still hypothesis-carried (never an axiom);
the carried object is now the RG-level per-scale bound `hRsc` rather
than the covariance-level `hUV`.  REMAINING (UV-SINGLE-SCALE-PLAN
U1–U4): define `covUV`/`R_{t,k}` concretely against the KP `clusterSum`
+ the scale dictionary (so `hcovUV` is a theorem), then discharge the
per-scale contraction itself (U2, the genuine Balaban analytic core —
a months-scale campaign).  All M3 lattice-side; M4/M5/Clay untouched.

A reusable real-analysis repackaging that turns EITHER area-law
headline bound `Nc·e^{P·K}·σ^{Area}·e^{P·S}` (`P = #loopSupp·4d` the
perimeter charge, `σ < 1` the area rate — the shape of both
`normalized_wilson_loop_area_law` and
`normalized_exp_wilson_loop_area_law`) into MANIFEST exponential decay
in the area, `Nc·e^{−τ·Area}` with a strictly positive string tension
`τ = (−log σ) − λ > 0`, on any loop family whose perimeter
contribution is area-subdominant (`P·(K+S) ≤ λ·Area`, `λ < −log σ`).
Pure analysis (`σ^{Area} = e^{Area·log σ}` via `Real.rpow_def_of_pos`,
`exp` monotonicity); the inequality reduces exactly to the
subdominance hypothesis.  Makes the confinement physics (positive
string tension) of the area law explicit.  ALSO (hard rule #3,
machine-checked non-vacuity): `area_law_to_exp_area_decay_window_nonempty`
exhibits an explicit witness (`σ = 1/2`, `P = K = S = 1`, `λ = 1/2`,
`Area = 4`) with non-degenerate perimeter charge AND strictly positive
string tension `τ = log 2 − 1/2 > 0` (via `Real.log_two_gt_d9`),
certifying the confinement conclusion is genuinely non-trivial.  All M3
lattice-side; M4/M5/Clay untouched.

## Addendum 21 (2026-06-12, **UV frontier audit — negative result +
shopping list**; no Lean change, core unchanged at 8238)

A research-grade audit of the UV frontier (the sole carried M3
hypothesis) established a clean negative result: the only UV-side
material in the tree — the `ClayCore` Balaban scaffolding
(`BalabanH1H2H3`, `SmallFieldBound`, `LargeFieldBound`,
`MultiscaleDecoupling`, `OscillationBound`, `CouplingControl`) — is
**physically vacuous**.  Its hypotheses bound *unconstrained*
existential reals (`∀ n, ∃ R, 0 ≤ R ∧ R ≤ …`, met by `R = 0`); the
"activity" is an arbitrary `Nat → Real` never tied to the Wilson action;
the files contain no `gaugeMeasureFrom`/`WilsonAction`/`sunHaarProb`/
integral; so `balaban_combined_bound : BalabanHyps ⟹ …` is a sound but
EMPTY implication.  This is why the files are correctly excluded from
`YangMillsCore`, and connecting them to the assembly is forbidden
(it would manufacture a green theorem that says nothing about
Yang–Mills — the hollow-progress pattern).  Genuine progress requires
DEFINING the per-scale RG contribution `R_{t,k}` against the actual
gauge measure and PROVING its bound — the Balaban block-spin
construction + single-scale stability estimates, which are NOT in the
repo.  Per mandate, reconstructing them from memory is declined on
honesty grounds; the precise source request (Eriksson [55] Thms
6.2/6.3/8.5; Bałaban CMP 116, 122-II Eq (1.98)–(1.100); Dimock's
"RG according to Balaban" I–III; the paper's `covUV` scale
decomposition) is recorded in `docs/UV-SHOPPING-LIST.md`.  The UV

date is unchanged and remains honest.  All M3 lattice-side;
M4/M5/Clay untouched.

After the user supplied the Balaban gauge series (CMP 95/96/98/99/102/
109/116/122-I/122-II), the Dimock trilogy ("RG according to Balaban"
I/II/III, φ⁴), and the Eriksson AQFT collection, a paper-grounded audit
of the UV frontier produced a **decisive strategic finding**: the §6.3
Balaban single-scale bound is needed only for the **continuum**
(lattice-spacing → 0) limit; the **fixed-lattice** clustering is
already UNCONDITIONAL via the banked cluster expansion.  Concretely,
`sun_two_plaquette_correlator_bound` (no carried hypothesis, only an
explicit smallness window certified non-empty by
`sun_clustering_window_nonempty`) is combined here, at separation
`k = ⌊dist/2⌋`, into:

> **`sun_lattice_exponential_clustering`** — for every `d, N_c` there
> is an explicit `β₀ > 0` such that for all `|β| ≤ β₀`, every bounded
> measurable plaquette observable `f` (`|f| ≤ 1`), and every pair of
> distinct plaquettes `p ≠ q`, the connected (truncated) two-plaquette
> correlator of the genuine SU(N_c) Wilson Gibbs measure satisfies
> `|⟨f_p f_q⟩ − ⟨f_p⟩⟨f_q⟩| ≤ C · exp(−(1/2)·dist(p,q))`, with `C`
> depending only on `d, N_c, β` — NO carried hypothesis.

In exactly the exponential-clustering sense the M3 assembly
(`lattice_mass_gap_of_exp_clustering_uniform`) calls "the lattice mass
gap", this is that statement, UNCONDITIONALLY, at strong coupling.
Proof: `sun_two_plaquette_correlator_bound` at `t = ε = 1`, the
non-empty window for all `k`, and the elementary
`exp(−k) ≤ e^{1/2}·e^{−dist/2}` from `dist ≤ 2⌊dist/2⌋+1`.

**HONEST SCOPE (no inflation).**  This is (i) FIXED lattice spacing —
the correlation length is in lattice units; (ii) STRONG coupling
(small `β`, the cluster-expansion/confining regime), not all `β`;
(iii) a EUCLIDEAN correlation-decay statement — it is NOT a
transfer-matrix/Hamiltonian spectral gap (that needs reflection
positivity + OS), and NOT the continuum mass gap (that needs the
lattice-spacing → 0 control the Balaban §6.3 input provides, plus
OS/Wightman reconstruction — M4/M5, open mathematics).  The §6.3
carried hypothesis therefore remains the sole obstruction to the
*continuum-uniform* statement, and is correctly localized there.
Distance to the Clay prize: **~0% (<0.1%), UNCHANGED** — this
strengthens and clarifies the lattice side, reducing no M4/M5
obstruction.  The Balaban/Dimock source material and the precise
remaining targets are catalogued in `docs/UV-SHOPPING-LIST.md` and
`docs/UV-SINGLE-SCALE-PLAN.md`.

Two outcomes after auditing the new uploads (CMP 116, CMP 119 — new;

claimed Clay solution by S. Borom, set aside as unrefereed/not
source-faithful for our constructions):

1. **B3-full design UNBLOCKED.**  CMP 119 recalls the averaging by
   reference to CMP 109 §0; **CMP 109 (1987) eqs (0.5)–(0.12)** give it
   in clean *axiomatic* form (Bałaban states results hold "universally
   for all averages satisfying the above properties"): a group average
   `M({U_j})` — analytic, permutation-invariant (0.7), with
   linearisation `log M({exp A_j}) = (1/n)ΣA_j + O(‖A‖²)` (0.8) [the tie
   to the linear `Q` of Add. 24], group-closed (0.9), inhabited by the
   **Federbush average** (0.10).  This replaces the OCR-garbled CMP 98
   eq (15) blocker at the design level (recorded in
   `docs/BALABAN-RG-PLAN.md`).

2. **B2 closed** (Bałaban CMP 98 (4)–(5), CMP 109 (0.4)/(0.12)):
   `blockBasepoint` — the lower-corner section of `blockSite`
   (`blockSite_blockBasepoint`, the axial-gauge representative); and the
   iterated-shift coordinate formula `iterShift_apply_self`
   (`shiftᵏ` advances the `μ`-coordinate by `k mod M`, the arithmetic of

The user supplied clean transcriptions of BOTH CMP 98 (14)–(15) and CMP
109 (0.5)–(0.12).  Per the source-faithful route, this brick formalises
**Bałaban's axiomatic group average** (CMP 109 (0.5)–(0.9)) — which he
states governs the construction "universally for all averages satisfying
the above properties": `structure GroupAverage G` over a `Group G`, with
`M : Multiset G → G`, inverse-equivariance `M({U⁻¹}) = (M)⁻¹` (0.5),
bi-equivariance `M({uUv}) = u·M·v` (0.6); permutation invariance (0.7) is
automatic (the domain is a `Multiset`) and group closure (0.9) automatic
(codomain `G`).  Derived: `left_equiv`, `right_equiv`, and the
**gauge-covariance seed** `conj_equiv : M({uU u⁻¹}) = u·M·u⁻¹` (0.6 at
`v=u⁻¹`) — the algebraic root of B4.  Non-vacuous: a constant/trivial `M`
violates (0.6).  The analytic axioms — the near-identity linearisation
(0.8) `(1/i)log M(exp iA_j) = n⁻¹ΣA_j + O(‖A‖²)` (tying `M` to the linear
operator `Q`=`linAvg` of Add. 24) and the Federbush characterisation
(0.10) — plus the averaging operator `Ū` itself (CMP 109 (0.12) / CMP 98
(15)) require a near-identity matrix-`log` framework not yet in the core;
they are carried as named obligations (never axioms), the next sub-brick.
Cross-check (honest): `linAvg` faithfully realises **CMP 95 (1.8)** (the
straight length-`L` line, `L^{-d}`); CMP 98 (14)/CMP 109 (0.12) use the
Euclidean-symmetric refined contour `Γ_{c,x}` with `L^{-(d+1)}`, so
`linAvg` is the CMP 95 prototype, not (yet) Balaban's final averaging —
not overclaimed.  `ssrn-5836022` (Borom) remains set aside.

## Addendum 27 (2026-06-12, **GroupAverage honesty fix + non-vacuity
certificate** `YangMills.RG.meanAverage`; core 8242)

**Build:** green (8242 jobs).  Oracle (verbatim, `RG/GroupAverage.lean`):

```

**Adversarial self-audit (correction of Add. 26).**  The `GroupAverage`
interface as first committed (Add. 26) stated its axioms over ALL
multisets, including the empty one — where bi-equivariance (0.6) reads
`M(∅) = u·M(∅)·v` for all `u,v`, forcing the group to be trivial.  So
the unrestricted interface was **unsatisfiable for `SU(N)`, i.e. vacuous**
(any `∀ GroupAverage, …` theorem would be hollow).  Fixed by restricting
the axioms (0.5),(0.6) — and the derived `left/right/conj_equiv` — to
**nonempty** multisets (`L ≠ 0`), exactly as Bałaban states them
(`{U_j : j = 1,…,n}`, `n ≥ 1`).  **Non-vacuity now certified
constructively:** `meanAverage V` inhabits the fixed interface for the
abelian prototype `G = Multiplicative V` (`V` a real vector space) via
the arithmetic mean `M(L) = (#L)⁻¹ • Σ_j A_j`; the proofs of (0.5)/(0.6)
are the genuine mean computations (the nonempty hypothesis enters as
`(#L : ℝ) ≠ 0`).  In additive terms this is precisely the linear
average, so the linearisation axiom (0.8) holds EXACTLY (no
higher-order terms) for this inhabitant — the abelian shadow of the
non-abelian (0.8) tying `M` to `linAvg`.  The non-abelian (0.8), the
Federbush characterisation (0.10), and the operator `Ū` (CMP 109 (0.12))
remain carried obligations awaiting a near-identity matrix-`log`
framework.  Source: Bałaban CMP 109 (0.5)–(0.10); Federbush [35];

## Addendum 28 (2026-06-12, **gauge-RG brick B4-prep — holonomy
gauge-covariance along a path** `YangMills.RG.wilsonLine_gaugeAct_path`;
core 8243)

**Build:** green (**8243 jobs**).  Oracle (verbatim,

'YangMills.RG.wilsonLine_gaugeAct_path'  [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
```

A determination first: the pinned Mathlib provides `Matrix.exp` and a
continuous-functional-calculus `log` (self-adjoint elements only) but
**no near-identity matrix logarithm with `log(exp X) = X` and BCH
bounds** — so the analytic axiom (0.8) and the operator `Ū` (CMP 109
(0.12)) genuinely require a from-scratch matrix-`log` layer (a real
sub-campaign; the BCH references are now in hand).  Rather than fake
that, this brick advances the **algebraic** B4 foundation, which needs
no matrix `log`: `wilsonLine_gaugeAct_path` — along a connected path
(`IsPathFrom a es`, the contour structure of CMP 95 (1.7)) the
gauge-transformed Wilson line conjugates by the gauge function at its
endpoints, `wilsonLine (gaugeAct u A) es = u(a)·wilsonLine A es·u(pathEnd a es)⁻¹`,
by a clean telescoping induction over the core `wilsonLine`/`gaugeAct`.
This is exactly the law (CMP 98 (11)) that, combined with
`GroupAverage.conj_equiv`/`biequiv`, makes the averaged contour variable
(0.11) — and hence `Ū` — gauge covariant (brick B4).  Strategy/framing:

```

The locality the renormalization-group cluster expansion relies on
(Bałaban CMP 116), for the linear averaging operator `Q` (needs no
matrix `log`): `linAvg A c` depends only on `A`'s values on the fine
bonds `⟨shiftᵏ x, c.dir, +⟩` for `x ∈ blockOf c.source`, `k < L` — the
fine links inside the coarse bond's block.  `fineLineSum_congr` (the
per-line version) + `linAvg_congr` (the block average) prove that two
bond fields agreeing on those bonds have equal `Q`-averages at `c`.
With B4-prep (the holonomy gauge law, Add. 28) this completes the
*algebraic* half of B4/B5 for the linear operator; the full non-abelian
`Ū` versions await the matrix-`log` layer.  Source: Bałaban CMP 95

`RG/AveragedContour.lean`).  Oracle (verbatim):

```
'YangMills.RG.averagedContour_gaugeAct'  [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
```

Bałaban's averaged contour variable (CMP 109 (0.11)) `U(y,x) =
M({U(Γ)}_{Γ∈G(y,x)})` — the group average of the holonomies along all
contours from `y` to `x` — is **gauge covariant**:
`Avg.M (paths.map (wilsonLine (gaugeAct u A))) =
u(y)·Avg.M (paths.map (wilsonLine A))·u(x)⁻¹`, for any group average
`Avg`, gauge transform `u`, config `A`, and any **nonempty** family
`paths` of connected contours all running `y→x`.  Proof: each contour
holonomy conjugates by `u` at the **same** endpoints (B4-prep,
`wilsonLine_gaugeAct_path`, Add. 28), so the whole `Multiset` of
holonomies is `(map (wilsonLine A)).map (W ↦ u(y)·W·u(x)⁻¹)`, and
bi-equivariance (0.6) of the average (`GroupAverage.biequiv`, Add. 26)
pulls the endpoint factors out.  Nonemptiness routed through
`Multiset.map_eq_zero` so `biequiv`'s `L ≠ 0` side condition is met
(the same non-vacuity discipline as Add. 27).

This needs **no matrix logarithm** — it is the gauge covariance (CMP 98
(11)) at the level of the averaged variable, the algebraic heart of B4.
What remains for the full field map `Ū` (brick B4-Ū) is to apply this
pointwise once `Ū` is defined (which does need the matrix-`log` layer).

## Addendum 31 (2026-06-12, **gauge-RG matrix-`log` layer, brick M-log-1

```

The averaging operator `Ū` (CMP 109 (0.12)) is built from the logarithm
of group elements near the identity, and Mathlib provides `NormedSpace.exp`
for Banach algebras but **no logarithm**.  This opens the from-scratch
matrix-`log` layer.  In any complete normed `ℝ`-algebra `𝔸` (matrices
over `ℝ`/`ℂ`, hence the `SU(N)` Lie algebra, qualify):

* `logCoeff n = (-1)^{n+1}/n` (`0` at `n=0`); `abs_logCoeff_le_one`;
* `nearLog Y = ∑' n, logCoeff n • Y^n` (the Mercator series for
  `log(1+Y)`);
* `norm_logCoeff_smul_pow_le : ‖logCoeff n • Y^n‖ ≤ ‖Y‖^n` (`|coeff|≤1`
  + `norm_pow_le'`);
* `summable_logCoeff_smul_pow` (‖Y‖<1): absolute convergence by
  comparison with the geometric series (`Summable.of_norm_bounded`,
  `summable_geometric_of_lt_one`);
* `norm_nearLog_le : ‖nearLog Y‖ ≤ (1-‖Y‖)⁻¹` — the geometric majorant
  the BCH estimates of CMP 109/122 consume (`norm_tsum_le_tsum_norm`,
  `Summable.tsum_le_tsum`, `tsum_geometric_of_lt_one`);
* `nearLog_zero : nearLog 0 = 0`.

Non-vacuity: the inhabiting algebra (`Matrix … ℝ`, `ℂ`) is a genuine
complete normed `ℝ`-algebra, and the convergence/bound are quantitative
(not existential).  The **next** brick (M-log-2) is the local-inverse
identity `log(exp X) = X` near `0` with the `O(‖X‖²)` remainder, which
unblocks the linearisation axiom (0.8) and then `Ū`.  Source: standard

`‖nearLog Y - Y‖ ≤ ‖Y‖²/(1-‖Y‖)` for `‖Y‖ < 1` — i.e.
`nearLog Y = Y + O(‖Y‖²)`.  This is **exactly the `O(‖·‖²)` remainder
content of Bałaban's linearisation axiom (0.8)** (CMP 109), the tie of
the averaging operator `M` to the linear operator `Q = linAvg`
(brick B3-linear), and it is obtained directly from the `n ≥ 2` tail of
the Mercator series — it does **not** require the local-inverse identity
`log(exp X)=X` (the still-open brick M-log-2b).  Proof: split the series
with `Summable.tsum_eq_zero_add` twice (`logCoeff 0 = 0` kills the
constant term, `logCoeff 1 = 1` gives the linear term `Y`), leaving the
tail `Σ_{n≥2} logCoeff n • Y^n`; bound it by `Σ_{n≥2} ‖Y‖^n =
‖Y‖²/(1-‖Y‖)` via `norm_tsum_le_tsum_norm`, `Summable.tsum_le_tsum`,
`tsum_mul_left`, `tsum_geometric_of_lt_one`.

What remains for the full (0.8) is **M-log-2b**, `log(exp X) = X` near

**Build:** green (8245 jobs).  Oracle:
`'YangMills.RG.norm_nearLog_le_linear' [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

`‖nearLog Y‖ ≤ ‖Y‖/(1-‖Y‖)` for `‖Y‖ < 1`.  This **supersedes**
`norm_nearLog_le` (`≤ (1-‖Y‖)⁻¹`) near the identity: the earlier bound
is `≥ 1` and does not vanish as `Y → 0`, whereas this one exhibits
`nearLog Y = O(‖Y‖)` — the correct small-field behaviour the RG analysis
requires.  Immediate from the linearisation (Add. 32) by the triangle
inequality: `‖nearLog Y‖ ≤ ‖nearLog Y - Y‖ + ‖Y‖ ≤ ‖Y‖²/(1-‖Y‖) + ‖Y‖
= ‖Y‖/(1-‖Y‖)`.

**Honest design note for M-log-2b (the next, genuinely hard brick).**
`log(exp X) = X` near `0` is the local-inverse identity.  Mathlib has
`NormedSpace.exp` (a Banach-algebra `exp`) but **no** matrix/operator
`log` and **no** Banach-algebra functional-calculus substitution lemma,
so the composition `log ∘ exp = id` is not available off the shelf.  The
viable route is the formal-power-series framework
(`FormalMultilinearSeries.comp` / formal inverse): realise the Mercator
series and `expSeries` as formal multilinear series, compose them to the
identity formally, then transfer to `nearLog`/`exp` on the radius of
convergence.  This is a multi-session sub-campaign; it is **not** faked
or stubbed here.  Until it lands, `Ū` (CMP 109 (0.12)) is **not**
defined (a `Ū` without its linearisation/covariance theorems would be
hollow, which the honesty rule forbids), and axiom (0.8) is **not**
claimed proved — only its `O(‖·‖²)` remainder (Add. 32) and the linear

Two facts certifying the matrix-`log` layer is **not vacuous**:

* `nearLog_real : nearLog (y : ℝ) = Real.log (1 + y)` for `|y| < 1` —
  on the real line the abstract Mercator sum `nearLog` agrees with the
  genuine `Real.log`.  Proof: drop the (zero) `n=0` term
  (`hasSum_nat_add_iff' 1`), match the tail termwise (`push_cast; ring`)
  against Mathlib's real Mercator series
  `Real.hasSum_pow_div_log_of_abs_lt_one` (negated, `x := -y`), then
  `HasSum.tsum_eq`.
* `nearLog_exp_sub_one_real : nearLog (Real.exp x - 1) = x` for
  `Real.exp x < 2` — the genuine **`log(exp x) = x`** identity in the
  commutative base case (`Real.log_exp`).

This is the **scalar instance of the operator brick M-log-2b**.  It does
NOT establish the operator identity `log(exp X) = X` in a noncommutative
Banach algebra (that still needs formal-power-series composition, the
Mathlib gap), and `Ū`/(0.8) remain unclaimed — but it removes any doubt

`Ū`, CMP 109 (0.12)): conjugation `z ↦ u·z·u⁻¹` is a continuous linear

for a unit `u`.  Assembled entirely from oracle-clean pieces —
`nearLog_sum_smul_conj` (Add. 36) for the exponent and Mathlib's
`NormedSpace.exp_units_conj` for the exponential — then a base-conjugation
cancellation (`u⁻¹·u = 1`).  **No** `log(exp)=id` (covariance is pure
conjugation-equivariance).  Carries one explicit, satisfiable instance

`exp Z = 1 + Z + O(‖Z‖²)`.  Proved from the `n ≥ 2` tail of the
exponential series (`NormedSpace.exp_eq_tsum ℝ`), mirroring
`norm_nearLog_sub_self_le`: split off the `n=0` term (`= 1`) and `n=1`

(termwise `‖(n!)⁻¹•Z^n‖ ≤ ‖Z‖^n`, brick `norm_expTerm_le`).

**Significance for (0.8):** combined with `nearLog Y = Y + O(‖Y‖²)`
(Add. 32) and the sharp bound `‖nearLog Y‖ ≤ ‖Y‖/(1-‖Y‖)` (Add. 33),
this gives `exp(nearLog Y) = 1 + Y + O(‖Y‖²)` — the genuine content of
Bałaban's linearisation axiom (0.8) (the RG map is the identity to first
order) **without** the exact local-inverse identity `log(exp)=id` (brick
M-log-2b).  Carries one explicit, satisfiable instance `[NormOneClass 𝔸]`

quantitative content of Bałaban's linearisation axiom (0.8): the
renormalization-group field map is the identity to first order plus an
explicitly-bounded quadratic correction.  Assembled by the triangle
inequality from the operator-exp remainder (M-log-4, Add. 38) applied
at `Z = nearLog Y` and the `nearLog` remainder (M-log-2a, Add. 32);
`‖nearLog Y‖<1` is discharged from `‖Y‖<1/2` via the sharp linear bound
(M-log-2a′, Add. 33).  The two quadratic contributions are kept explicit
(no constant-chasing).  Carries `[NormOneClass 𝔸]` (satisfiable, matrix

**Strategic consequence.** The exact local-inverse identity `log(exp)=id`
(M-log-2b) is now demoted from blocker to optional polish: gauge

Introduces the bridge between the abstract lattice gauge group and the
matrix algebra where `Ū`'s `exp`/`log` covariance lives:

* `class MatrixRealization (G) (𝔸)` — a representation `rep : G →* 𝔸ˣ`
  of the lattice gauge group as units of a complete normed ℝ-algebra.
  Inhabited (e.g. `G = 𝔸ˣ`, identity hom), hence **non-vacuous**; the
  physical instance is `SU(N)`'s defining representation.
* `rep_wilsonLine_gaugeAct` — the lattice holonomy gauge law
  (`wilsonLine_gaugeAct_path`, Add. 28) transported into `𝔸ˣ` through
  `rep`: `rep(wilsonLine(gaugeAct u A) es) = rep(u a)·rep(wilsonLine A es)·rep(u end)⁻¹`
  (just `map_mul`/`map_inv` on the group-level law).

This connects the abstract `GaugeConfig`/`wilsonLine` core to the
algebra-level conjugation laws (`nearLog_conj`, `UbarBlock_conj`) that
make `Ū` gauge covariant.  What remains (B4-Ū full) is to assemble the
concrete lattice `Ū` from the realized contour variables and instantiate
`UbarBlock_conj` — a definitional task on top of this bridge, no analysis.

Opens the small-field per-scale-contraction campaign

`‖linAvg A c‖² ≤ (L^d)⁻¹·L · ∑_{(x,k)∈block×range L} ‖A⟨shiftᵏ x, dir, +⟩‖²`.
The certified Cauchy–Schwarz mean-square bound on the block average,
with factor `(L^d)⁻¹·L = L^{1-d}`.  **Honest calibration (adversarial
self-audit):** this is *not* a standalone contraction — the line
integral sums `L` fine bonds, so on a constant field of size `ε` the
right side is `L^{1-d}·L^{d+1}·ε² = L²ε²`, i.e. coarse-bond *growth* by
`L` (correct: a coarse bond spans `L` fine bonds).  Bałaban's per-scale
contraction appears only after the RG **field rescaling** and the
**ℓ²(lattice) operator assembly with multiplicity** (brick S2); S1 is
the certified Cauchy–Schwarz input to that, not the contraction itself.
Proof:
collapse the block double sum to a sum over `blockOf ×ˢ range L`
(`Finset.sum_product`), bound the smul-norm by the ℓ¹ sum
(`norm_smul`, `norm_sum_le`), square (`pow_le_pow_left₀`), and apply
Cauchy–Schwarz (`sq_sum_le_card_mul_sum_sq`) with
`#(blockOf ×ˢ range L) = L^d·L` (`Finset.card_product`, `blockOf_card`).

This is the **first brick of U1** (`docs/UV-SINGLE-SCALE-PLAN.md`), the
small-field half of the per-scale RG-stability bound `|R_k| ≤ M·rᵏ`.
Honest scope: S1 is the deterministic Cauchy–Schwarz seed; the genuine
analytic core (**S2**, the Gaussian/propagator covariance contraction,
Bałaban CMP 95–96) remains a months-scale campaign requiring the

`∑_{y',μ} ‖linAvg A ⟨y',μ,+⟩‖² ≤ (L^d)⁻¹·L² · ∑_{z,μ} ‖A⟨z,μ,+⟩‖²`, i.e.
`∑_bonds ‖Q A‖² ≤ L^{2-d}·∑_bonds ‖A‖²`.  **This corrects and completes
the S1 audit (Add. 42):** while the *per-bond* Cauchy–Schwarz bound is
not a contraction (the line sum grows by `L`), the *ℓ²-summed* bound IS
— the factor is `L^{2-d}`, which is `< 1` for `d ≥ 3` (the physical
`d = 4` gives `L^{-2}`).  The bare averaging operator is a genuine
**ℓ²-contraction**, the deterministic backbone of Bałaban's small-field
RG step.

Mechanism (and why the exponent is `2-d` not `1-d`): summing the
per-bond bound (Add. 42, factor `L^{1-d}`) over all bonds, each fine
bond `⟨z,μ,+⟩` is hit by **exactly `L`** of the block/line triples — the
blocks tile the lattice (`sum_blockOf`, the fibers of `blockSite`) and
for each line offset `k` the shift `(shift μ)^[k]` is a bijection
(`shift_bijective`/`iterShift_bijective`, two-sided inverse
`shiftBack`).  So the multiplicity is `L`, giving `L^{1-d}·L = L^{2-d}`.
Proof: `Finset.sum_fiberwise_of_maps_to` (partition),
`Function.Bijective.sum_comp` (reindex per `k`), `Finset.sum_const`
(the `L` copies).

This is the genuine, certified deterministic contraction of brick S1′;

on finite-dimensional fibres; linearity from `linAvg_add`/`linAvg_smul`),
with `linAvgCLM_apply : linAvgCLM L N' A = linAvg L N' A`.

**Why this is on the critical path (not scaffolding).**  A verified
Mathlib finding (2026-06-12): `ProbabilityTheory.isGaussian_map
(L : E →L[ℝ] F) : IsGaussian (μ.map L)` is an *instance* — the
pushforward of a Gaussian under a CLM is Gaussian.  So `linAvgCLM` is
exactly the object whose Gaussian pushforward is the **free
renormalization-group step** (`docs/UV-S2-GAUSSIAN-PLAN.md`, opening the
S2 campaign): the coarse free field is automatically Gaussian, and its
covariance is controlled by the proven operator contraction
`linAvg_l2_le`/`linAvg_l2_contraction` (Add. 43–44).  S2's free-field
core (G1–G4) is therefore reachable on existing Mathlib infrastructure;

and a dual functional `L`:
`covarianceBilinDual (μ.map Q) L L = covarianceBilinDual μ (L∘Q) (L∘Q)`.
Pushing a Gaussian forward under `Q` transforms its covariance bilinear
form by precomposition with `Q` on the dual — the free
renormalization-group step on the covariance, `C ↦ Q C Qᵀ`.  Proved on
Mathlib's `ProbabilityTheory.IsGaussian` framework: the diagonal of the
covariance form is the variance (`covarianceBilinDual_self_eq_variance`,
using `IsGaussian.memLp_two_id` — valid for `μ.map Q` too, Gaussian via
the `isGaussian_map` instance), and variance pushes back under the map
(`variance_map`).

**Significance.** Together with `isGaussian_map` (coarse field is
Gaussian) and the proven operator contraction `linAvg_l2_le`/
`linAvg_l2_contraction` (Add. 43–44), this is the **free fixed-point**

the deterministic `‖Q‖² ≤ L^{2-d}` (`linAvg_l2_le`, Add. 43) at

(Bałaban's faithful polymer bound, CMP 122-II / [III] §2 2.31[III]/1.100)
together give `∀k, |R_k| ≤ (A·C^{κ₀})·rᵏ` — the surrogate consumed by
`Paper.uv_geometric_summation`.  Proof: `g_k^{κ₀} ≤ (C·rᵏ)^{κ₀} =
C^{κ₀}·(rᵏ)^{κ₀} ≤ C^{κ₀}·rᵏ` (the last via `Real.rpow_le_rpow_of_exponent_ge`,
`(rᵏ)^{κ₀} ≤ (rᵏ)^1` for `0 < rᵏ ≤ 1`, `κ₀ ≥ 1`), then `Real.rpow_le_rpow`/
`Real.mul_rpow`.

**Why this is the honest closer, not a shortcut.**  It encodes ONLY the
logical transfer; the two analytically-hard facts are the explicit
hypotheses `hg` (coupling-flow decay — the RG stability of the coupling)
and `hpoly` (the polymer/cluster bound — the Dimock fluctuation integral
+ cluster-expansion-with-holes).  Neither is claimed proved.  The

**HONESTY CAVEAT (critical, recorded in the module header and

**irrelevant-operator** mechanism (`r < 1` = canonical scaling of an
irrelevant operator, e.g. `L^{−2}`).  The **4D marginal gauge coupling**
decays only **logarithmically** (`λ_n ∼ 1/(βn)`, asymptotic freedom — the
`α=1` telescoping of the same reference), so `g_k ≤ C·rᵏ` is FALSE for the
4D marginal coupling.  In 4D YM the geometric remainder contraction comes
from the irrelevant operators' scaling; the recursion `hrec` here models
those, `r` is their factor.  No inflation of 4D applicability.

This discharges one of the bridge's two hypotheses (`hg`) for the
relevant mechanism; the other (`hpoly`, the cluster expansion / Dimock
fluctuation integral) remains the months-scale analytic core (sources

vs Dimock III arXiv:1304.0705, must be read off the page).  This shrinks
the frontier by the summation step and isolates the remaining content
precisely: the carried `hact`/`hwK` (the cluster expansion itself) and
`hrec` (the coupling recursion) are the genuinely-unproved analytic
inputs — the months-scale core, NOT done here, NOT claimed.

**Build:** green (8251 jobs).  Oracle:
`'YangMills.RG.geometric_size_summability' [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

`∑_n c_n·qⁿ ≤ (1 − C·q)⁻¹` for `0 ≤ c_n ≤ Cⁿ`, `0 ≤ q`, `0 ≤ C`,
`C·q < 1`.  The Kotecký–Preiss / Appendix-F convergence criterion in its
analytic core: per-size polymer count `c_n` bounded by the animal bound
`Cⁿ`, per-size decay `q = e^{−κ₀}`, smallness `C·q < 1` ⟹ geometric
summability with `K₀ = (1−Cq)⁻¹`.  This **reduces the cluster-expansion
summability `hwK`** (consumed by `polymer_remainder_bound`, Add. 50) to
the **polymer animal-counting bound `c_n ≤ Cⁿ`** — pure lattice
combinatorics, the one remaining elementary input on the summability
branch.  Proof: termwise comparison `c_n qⁿ ≤ (Cq)ⁿ` + `tsum_geometric_of_lt_one`.

Status: the cluster-expansion-with-holes (`hact`/`hwK`) now decomposes
into (i) the activity-decay bound `hact` (the renormalized polymer
activity estimate, Dimock II/III — still the months-scale core) and
(ii) the summability `hwK`, whose analytic convergence is now reduced
(this addendum) to the combinatorial animal count.  Source Dimock I/II/III,

## Addendum 52 (2026-06-12, **gauge-RG — end-to-end UV conditional:
cluster bound + coupling decay ⟹ lattice mass gap**
`YangMills.RG.lattice_mass_gap_of_cluster_and_coupling`; core 8252)

Closes the loop end-to-end.  From
* `hRpoly`: the RG remainder activity bound `|R_{t,k}| ≤ A·e^{−c₀t}·g_k^{κ₀}`
  (spatial decay × coupling power — the Dimock cluster-expansion output),
* `hg`: the coupling-flow decay `g_k ≤ C·rᵏ`,
* `hIRbound`: the theorem-fed IR clustering bound,
* `hcovUV`: `covUV t = ∑_{k<nsc t} R_{t,k}` (covariance as scale-sum),

it derives the **lattice mass gap**
`∃ gap > 0, ∀ t, |covIR t + covUV t| ≤ (C₁ + A·C^{κ₀}·(1−r)⁻¹)·e^{−gap·t}`.
Proof: for each distance `t`, `coupling_flow_bridge` (Add. 48) with
amplitude `A·e^{−c₀t}` turns `hRpoly`/`hg` into the per-scale bound
`|R_{t,k}| ≤ (A·C^{κ₀}·e^{−c₀t})·rᵏ` = the `hRsc` hypothesis of the banked
`lattice_mass_gap_of_per_scale_uv` (Add. 19), which then yields the gap.

**Significance.**  The entire §6.3 UV branch is now a SINGLE oracle-clean
conditional theorem whose only unproved inputs are the two faithful
Bałaban analytic facts — the cluster-expansion activity bound `hRpoly`
and the coupling-flow decay `hg`.  Everything from those to the lattice
mass gap (the bridge, the geometric summation, the assembly) is verified.
The §6.3 obligation is thus reduced, end to end, to `hRpoly` + `hg`.
Honest caveats unchanged: `hg`'s geometric form is the irrelevant
mechanism (4D marginal coupling is logarithmic, Add. 49); discharging
`hRpoly` is the months-scale cluster-expansion-with-holes core; and even
a full discharge gives only the *lattice* gap (M4/M5 untouched, Clay

core 8252)

**Build:** green (8252 jobs).  Oracle:
`'YangMills.RG.polymer_weight_summability' [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

For polymers `Y` graded by `size : ι → ℕ` with finite per-size fibers,
animal-count bound `#{size = n} ≤ Cⁿ`, per-size decay `q` with `C·q < 1`
(and the weights summable):
`∑_Y q^{size Y} ≤ (1 − C·q)⁻¹`.  This **reduces the cluster-expansion
summability `hwK`** (the `∑_{X⊇□} e^{−κ₀ d} ≤ K₀` substrate, with
`q = e^{−κ₀}`, `K₀ = (1−Cq)⁻¹`) to the **polymer animal-counting bound
`c_n ≤ Cⁿ`** — pure lattice combinatorics.  So the summability branch of
`hRpoly` no longer needs a carried *analytic* hypothesis; it needs only a
combinatorial count.  Proof: fiber decomposition by `size`
(`Equiv.sigmaFiberEquiv`, `Summable.tsum_sigma`, per-fiber
`tsum_fintype`/`Finset.sum_const`), landing on `geometric_size_summability`
(Add. 51).

The cluster-expansion-with-holes now decomposes as: (i) the
activity-*decay* bound `|H_k(Y)| ≤ amp·q^{size Y}` (the Dimock fluctuation
integral + holes localization — the months-scale analytic core, carried);
(ii) the summability, now reduced (this addendum) to the animal count.

For the marginal recursion `g_{k+1} = g_k·(1 − β·g_k)` (`α = 1`, the 4D
case) with `0 < g_k`, `β·g_k < 1`, `0 ≤ β`: **the inverse coupling grows
at least linearly**, `1/g_0 + β·n ≤ 1/g_n`.  Hence `g_n ≤ (1/g_0 + βn)⁻¹
→ 0` like `1/(βn)` — **logarithmic, not geometric**.  Proof: reciprocal
telescoping, `1/g_{k+1} = (1/g_k)·(1−x)⁻¹ ≥ (1/g_k)(1+x) = 1/g_k + β`
(`x = β g_k`, `(1−x)(1+x) = 1−x² ≤ 1`), then induction.

This is the **honest counterpart** to the geometric (irrelevant) decay
`logistic_geometric_decay` (Add. 49): it *proves* that `g_k ≤ C·rᵏ` is
FALSE for the 4D marginal gauge coupling (asymptotic freedom), confirming
in Lean the honesty caveat carried throughout — the geometric remainder
contraction in 4D comes from the *irrelevant operators'* scaling, not the
marginal coupling.  Source: Faria da Veiga–O'Carroll 2024 (marginal

Tighter form of `lattice_mass_gap_of_cluster_and_coupling` (Add. 52): the
coupling-flow *decay* hypothesis `hg : g_k ≤ C·rᵏ` is **replaced by the
fundamental logistic RG recursion** `g_{k+1} ≤ r·g_k·(1−β·g_k)`
(`0 ≤ β·g_k ≤ 1`).  The decay is derived internally
(`logistic_geometric_decay`, Add. 49), so the coupling input is now the
β-function recursion itself, not an assumed bound.  Conclusion unchanged:
(cluster activity bound `hRpoly` + coupling recursion `hrec` + IR bound +
covariance scale-sum) ⟹ the lattice mass gap.

So the UV conditional's coupling input is now the **RG recursion**, and
the only remaining genuinely-analytic carried input is the

IR profile `covIR k = e^{−k}`, `nsc ≡ 1`, constants
`ε=c0=A=κ₀=C1=1, r=1/2, β=0`.  All eleven hypotheses
(positivity/window conditions, the logistic recursion, the IR bound, the
covariance scale-sum, and the cluster activity bound) are proved for this
witness.  So the conditional is **not a vacuously-applicable implication**:
its premise set is inhabited by genuine data.  (`β=0` is the simplest

## Addendum 57 (2026-06-13, **hRpoly campaign brick P1a — the bounded-degree
walk-count engine** `YangMills.RG.card_walks_length_le_degree_pow`; core 8253)

**Build:** green (**8253 jobs**, +1 over Add. 56's 8252 — module
`YangMills/RG/AnimalCount.lean` added to the core).  Oracle:
`'…card_walks_length_le_degree_pow' [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

First **code** brick of the `hRpoly` campaign (`docs/HRPOLY-CAMPAIGN-PLAN.md`,
opened by the P0 design doc, Add. preceding).  Branch C of `hRpoly` (the
geometric summability `∑_{X⊇□} e^{−κ₀ d_M} ≤ K₀`) was already reduced to the
**lattice animal count** `c_n ≤ Cⁿ` (Add. 53, `polymer_weight_summability`).
The standard route to that geometric count encodes a connected size-`n`
polymer as a bounded-length DFS **walk** on the cube-adjacency graph; this
brick supplies the engine controlling the walk count:

> **`card_walks_length_le_degree_pow`** — for any `SimpleGraph` with
> `∀ w, G.degree w ≤ Δ`, the total number of length-`n` walks from a fixed
> vertex `u` satisfies `∑_v #{p : Walk u v | p.length = n} ≤ Δⁿ`.

Proof: induction on `n` via Mathlib's recursive `finsetWalkLength` description
(`card_finsetWalkLength_succ_le`, itself `Finset.card_biUnion_le` +
`Finset.card_map`), `Finset.sum_comm`, and `card_neighborSet_eq_degree`.
Pure graph combinatorics — no measure theory, no cluster expansion; needs
no Bałaban/Dimock source material (only the degree bound enters the
constant).  **Non-vacuity:** a genuine `≤` on a generally-nonzero count
(at `n = 0` it is exactly `1 ≤ Δ⁰`); the hypothesis `∀ w, G.degree w ≤ Δ`
is satisfiable for every finite graph.  Not a restatement, not vacuous.

**Documented consumer:** the animal-count brick **P1b** (encode a connected
size-`n` polymer into a length-`≤ 2n` walk, then `Fintype.card_le_of_injective`)
→ `RG.polymer_weight_summability`.  Source: standard self-avoiding-walk /

## Addendum 58 (2026-06-13, **hRpoly P1b-ii engine — the detour splice**
`YangMills.RG.exists_detour_walk`; core 8253)

**Build:** green (8253 jobs — new *theorem* in the existing
`RG/AnimalCount.lean`, no new module, so the job count is unchanged per
rule 7).  Oracle: `'…exists_detour_walk' [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

The inductive engine of the tree Euler tour (campaign sub-brick P1b-ii,
`docs/HRPOLY-CAMPAIGN-PLAN.md`):

> **`exists_detour_walk`** — for a closed walk `w : G.Walk r r`, a vertex
> `p ∈ w.support`, and a neighbour `u` of `p` (`G.Adj p u`), there is a
> closed walk `w'` with `w'.length = w.length + 2` and
> `w'.support.toFinset = insert u w.support.toFinset`.

Construction: `(w.takeUntil p hp).append (cons hpu (cons hpu.symm (w.dropUntil p hp)))`
— split `w` at `p`, splice the detour `p→u→p`, rejoin.  Length via
`take_spec` + `length_append`/`length_cons`; support via `support_append` +
`mem_support_append_iff` (the duplicate `x = p` disjunct is absorbed because
`p` is the endpoint of `takeUntil`, `end_mem_support`).  Pure Mathlib walk
surgery — no trees, no measure theory, no source material.  **Non-vacuity:**
a constructive existence with exact, non-degenerate length/support equalities
(length strictly grows by 2; support strictly gains `u` when `u ∉ w.support`).

**Role.**  Iterating this over the leaves of a spanning tree (P1b-i) yields a
closed walk of length `2·(#S−1)` whose support is a connected set `S`; that
walk is the injection `animal ↪ walk` consumed against P1a
(`card_walks_length_le_degree_pow`) to give the animal count `c_n ≤ (Δ²)ⁿ`
(P1b-iii → branch C).  Remaining in P1b: the leaf-induction assembly

## Addendum 59 (2026-06-13, **hRpoly P1b/P1c — the lattice animal count**
`YangMills.RG.animal_card_le` + the spanning-tour chain; core 8254)

**Build:** green (**8254 jobs**, +1 over Add. 58 — new module
`YangMills/RG/AnimalTour.lean`).  Oracle (all three):
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

Branch C of `hRpoly` (the geometric summability) was reduced to the lattice
animal count `c_n ≤ Cⁿ` (Add. 53).  This addendum **closes that count**:

> **`animal_card_le`** — any family `A` of `S`-connected vertex sets of size
> `n`, each containing the root `r`, on a graph of max degree `≤ Δ`, has
> `A.card ≤ Δ^{2(n−1)}` (i.e. `c_n ≤ Cⁿ` with `C = Δ²`).

Proven via the classical spanning-walk encoding, all in the ambient graph
(no induced-subgraph type surgery), through two reusable lemmas:

* **`exists_peel`** (P1b-i) — the `r`-farthest vertex (max `mlen`, the
  minimal in-`S` walk length, defined by `sInf`) of an `S`-connected set is
  removable: deletion preserves `S`-connectivity and it keeps an inside
  neighbour.  The "max-distance vertex is not a cut vertex" fact, proved by a
  `takeUntil`/`dropUntil` length comparison (`dropUntil` length `0 ⇒ u = z`).
* **`exists_spanning_closed_walk`** (P1b-ii) — induction on `#S`: peel the
  farthest vertex, recurse, splice it back with `exists_detour_walk`
  (Add. 58).  Gives a closed walk from `r` of length `2(n−1)`, support `= S`.
* **`animal_card_le`** (P1c) — the guarded map `animal ↦ spanning closed walk`
  is injective (animal `=` walk support); the length-`2(n−1)` closed walks
  number `≤ Δ^{2(n−1)}` by P1a (`card_walks_length_le_degree_pow`).

Pure graph combinatorics; no measure theory, no cluster expansion, no
Bałaban/Dimock source.  **Non-vacuity:** a genuine cardinality bound on a
satisfiable hypothesis set (e.g. `A = {{r}}`, `n = 1`: `1 ≤ Δ⁰ = 1`); the
spanning walk is produced by construction with the stated support and length.

**Dependency moved.** Branch C of `hRpoly` is now closed *as graph
combinatorics* down to its single remaining interface task — **P2**, the
polymer model: define the cube-adjacency graph (degree `2d`), the polymer
type, and feed `animal_card_le` into `RG.polymer_weight_summability` (whose
`hcount` wants `c_n` as a `Fintype.card`).  The hard analytic cores P3/P4
(cluster expansion with holes; fluctuation integral) still await verbatim
Dimock source.  Source: Madras–Slade; strategy/framing **Lluis Eriksson**

## Addendum 60 (2026-06-13, **hRpoly branch C closed as graph combinatorics**
`YangMills.RG.rooted_connected_weight_summable`; core 8254)

**Build:** green (8254 jobs — new theorems in `RG/AnimalTour.lean`, no new
module).  Oracle (both): `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

Two bridge theorems convert the animal count (Add. 59) into the form the
cluster-expansion summability consumes, and then **close the summability
branch**:

* **`rooted_connected_card_le` / `rooted_connected_card_le_pow`** — the
  animal count as an actual cardinal:
  `Nat.card {S : Finset V // r ∈ S ∧ S.card = n ∧ S-connected} ≤ Δ^{2(n−1)}`,
  and (for `Δ ≥ 1`) `≤ (Δ²)ⁿ` — the exact `c_n ≤ Cⁿ` shape of
  `polymer_weight_summability`'s `hcount` (`Fintype.card_subtype` + P1c).
* **`rooted_connected_weight_summable`** — for a bounded-degree graph
  (`Δ ≥ 1`) and `q` with `Δ²q < 1`,
  `∑_Y q^{#Y} ≤ (1 − Δ²q)⁻¹` over all `S`-connected rooted sets `Y`.
  Composes `rooted_connected_card_le_pow` with `polymer_weight_summability`
  (`RG/PolymerRemainder.lean`); the `Summable` premise is free (the polymer
  index type is finite, `Summable.of_finite`).  This **is** Dimock's
  `∑_{X⊇□} e^{−κ₀ d(X)} ≤ K₀` (with `q = e^{−κ₀}`, `K₀ = (1−Δ²q)⁻¹`) —
  now reduced to pure graph combinatorics with explicit constants.

**Dependency moved.**  Branch C of `hRpoly` (the geometric summability
substrate `hwK`) is **closed as graph combinatorics**: from the
bounded-degree hypothesis it is now a *proved theorem*, not a carried input,
on the abstract rooted-connected-set model.  The remaining link is the **P2
instantiation** — identify Dimock's `M`-cube polymers with rooted connected
sets of the cube-adjacency graph (degree `2d`), and set `q = e^{−κ₀}` — at
which point `hwK` is literally discharged in the §6.3 UV conditional.  The
hard analytic cores P3 (cluster expansion with holes) / P4 (fluctuation
integral) still await verbatim Dimock source.  **Non-vacuity:** the
summability bound holds on a satisfiable hypothesis set (`Δ ≥ 1`, `Δ²q < 1`,
e.g. small `q`); the constants are explicit and finite.  Source:
Madras–Slade (animal counting), Kotecký–Preiss (the geometric criterion);
strategy/framing **Lluis Eriksson** (ai.viXra:2602.0088).  Continuum (M4)

## Addendum 61 (2026-06-13, **hRpoly P2 geometry — the `M`-cube adjacency graph

**Build:** green (**8255 jobs**, +1 — new module `RG/CubeLattice.lean`).
Oracle (both): `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

With the Dimock II source now in hand (see the source-attribution corrections
below), the `M`-cube polymer geometry is made concrete:

* **`cubeAdj d L`** — the `M`-cube **king-adjacency** `SimpleGraph` on
  `(ZMod L)^d` (differ by `0,±1` in each coordinate; Chebyshev `ℓ^∞`
  distance 1), Dimock II §3.1.2's adjacency, coordination number `3^d − 1`.
* **`cubeAdj_degree_le`** — `degree ≤ 3^d`, via the displacement injection
  `y ↦ (i ↦ y i − x i) ∈ {0,1,−1}^d` (`Fintype.piFinset` + `prod_le_pow_card`).
* **`cube_polymer_summable`** — instantiates `rooted_connected_weight_summable`
  on `cubeAdj`: `∑_Y q^{#Y} ≤ (1 − (3^d)²q)⁻¹` for `(3^d)²q < 1`, the
  geometric summability on the actual lattice geometry with the explicit
  coordination constant `Δ = 3^d`.

The source confirms this is the right object: Dimock II §3.1.2 says a polymer
is a connected union of `M`-cubes, a spanning tree on `n` cubes is explored by
a walk of `≤ 2n` steps, and size-`n` polymers containing a fixed cube number
`≤ cⁿ` with `c ∝ 3^d − 1` — exactly `exists_spanning_closed_walk` /
`animal_card_le`.  **Non-vacuity:** `cubeAdj` is a genuine graph (`L ≥ 1`),
the bound holds for satisfiable `q` (e.g. small `q`), and the rooted-polymer
index type is inhabited by `{r}`.

### Source-attribution corrections (Dimock arXiv:1212.5562, confirmed)
Prior docs had three misattributions, now corrected (see
`docs/BALABAN-SOURCE-BOUNDS.md`, `HRPOLY-CAMPAIGN-PLAN.md` §4):
1. **Appendix F ("cluster expansion with holes") is in Part II**, and its
   convergence is self-contained there (it follows Part I App B), **not** in
   Part III.  Theorem F.1 constants `H₀ ≤ c₀`, `κ ≥ 3κ₀+3`, conclusion
   `O(1)H₀ e^{−(κ−3κ₀−3)d_M(Y, mod Ω^c)}` — confirmed verbatim.
2. The `d_M(X, mod Ω^c)` definition + the summability `∑_{X⊇□} e^{−κ₀ d_M} ≤ K₀`
   are in the **§3 main text (§3.1.2, ~eqs 150–151)**, not Appendix F.
3. The raw activity bound feeding F.1 is in **§3.14** (Lemma 3.18, eq. ~500/506:
   `|H_{k,Π}^+(Y)| ≤ O(1)L³ λ_k^{1/4−10ε} e^{−L(κ−3κ₀−3)d_{LM}(Y, mod Ω^c)}`),
   **not §3.8** (§3.8 is the fluctuation-integral / covariance-localization
   setup).  The coupling is **`λ_k`** (`λ_k = L^{−(N−k)}λ`), not `g_k`;
   `p_k = (−log λ_k)^p`, `α_k = max(λ_k^{1/4}, μ̄_k^{1/2})`; and `H₀ ≍ O(1)L³ λ_k^{1/4−10ε}`.

**CRITICAL model caveat.**  Dimock II/III treats **`φ⁴₃`** (3D scalar UV
problem), so its activity constants (`λ_k^{1/4−10ε}`, the `L³`, the
relevant-coupling `λ_k = L^{−(N−k)}λ`) are **NOT** the 4D Yang–Mills values.
Appendix F is reused as a *general polymer lemma*; the YM activity bounds and
the (logarithmic, marginal) 4D coupling flow come from Bałaban's YM papers,
not from these `φ⁴₃` numbers.  **Clay distance ~0% (<0.1%), unchanged** — this
is lattice combinatorics on a concrete graph; no continuum/OS content.

geometric bound `g_k ≤ C·rᵏ` (`r < 1`) is **false** for the marginal coupling
(it holds only for *irrelevant* couplings, as in Dimock's superrenormalizable
φ⁴₃).  This addendum supplies the *honest* YM coupling side:

* **`marginal_coupling_pow_summable`** — from the asymptotic-freedom lower
  bound `1/g₀ + β·n ≤ 1/gₙ` (the conclusion of `inv_coupling_linear_growth`,
  Add. ~46), `β > 0`, `κ₀ > 1`: the series `∑ₙ gₙ^{κ₀}` **converges**.  So
  although the marginal coupling does not decay geometrically, the
  renormalization-remainder series over scales is still summable for activity
  power `κ₀ > 1`.  Proof: `gₙ ≤ 1/(c(n+1))` then comparison with the `p`-series
  `∑ n^{−κ₀}` (`Real.summable_nat_rpow_inv`).
* **`marginal_coupling_tendsto_zero`** — asymptotic freedom: `gₙ → 0`.
* **`marginal_coupling_pow_summable_of_recursion`** — the same, directly from
  the marginal recursion `g_{k+1} = g_k(1 − β g_k)`.

**Dependency moved.**  The UV `hg` side of `lattice_mass_gap_of_cluster_and_coupling`
used a geometric `g_k ≤ C·rᵏ` — *model-incorrect for YM*.  This brick gives the
correct marginal-coupling summability `∑ g_k^{κ₀} < ∞` (`κ₀ > 1`), the honest
object on which a YM remainder assembly should rest.  It does **not** supply
the YM activity-decay bound (carried; see source map).  **Non-vacuity:** the
hypotheses are satisfiable (e.g. `g_n = g_0/(1+β g_0 n)`-type flows); the
series bound is a genuine convergence, not vacuous.

### Bałaban Yang–Mills source map (lattice SU(N) RG series, all CMP)
For the genuine YM `hRpoly` activity input (NOT Dimock φ⁴₃):
* **CMP 116 (1988), "RG approach to LGT II: Cluster expansions", Lemma 3 /
  eq. (2.38):** the single-scale YM activity bound
  `|H(Z)| ≤ C₃ ε₁ exp(−(1−8δ)^{1/2} L κ d_{k+1}(Z))`; eq. (2.41) exponentiates
  to the effective-action bound `|E^{(k+1)}(X)| ≤ O(1)C₃ε₁ e^{−(1−10δ)^{1/2}Lκ d(X)}`,
  giving the inductive `(I.1.18)`.  **This is the closest source-faithful
  `hRpoly`.**
* **CMP 122-I/II (1989), "Large field renormalization":** the `R`-operation and
  the complete-model remainder bound `|R^{(k)}(X)| ≤ e^{−p₀(g_k)} e^{−κ d_k(X)}`
  (the large-field/holes part); 122-II Theorem 1 = UV stability.
* **CMP 119 (1988), "Convergent renormalization expansions":** the complete
  effective density `A_k = A + E_k + R_k + B_k`, large-field domains.
* **CMP 109 (1987), "RG approach to LGT I":** small-field effective actions and
  the **recursive (marginal) coupling renormalization** — the source for the
  marginal/logarithmic flow this addendum formalizes.
* **CMP 99 (1985), background-field propagators:** the source of the decay
  constant `κ`.
* **Critical:** Bałaban's series proves **UV stability**, *not* a mass gap.
  There is **no Bałaban mass-gap theorem**; any `R_k → mass gap` step is an
  open conjecture, carried as a hypothesis, never a cited lemma.  Clay distance

**Build:** green (8256 jobs — theorem added to `RG/MarginalCoupling.lean`, no

The honest YM analogue of the geometric coupling bridge, consuming Add. 62's
marginal-coupling summability: given the carried Bałaban YM activity bound
`|R_{t,k}| ≤ A·e^{−c₀t}·g_k^{κ₀}` and `Summable (g_·^{κ₀})` (the marginal
coupling, NOT geometric), the scale-summed remainder satisfies
`∑ₖ |R_{t,k}| ≤ A·e^{−c₀t}·(∑ₖ g_k^{κ₀})`.  So the UV remainder retains the
spatial gap factor `e^{−c₀t}`, with the scale series contributing only a
bounded constant — the coupling side discharged for the marginal YM flow with
no false geometric-decay assumption.  `tsum_le_tsum` + `tsum_mul_left`, the
summand summability by comparison.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 64 (2026-06-13, **the marginal-coupling UV mass-gap conditional**
`YangMills.RG.lattice_mass_gap_of_cluster_and_marginal_coupling`; core 8257)

**Build:** green (**8257 jobs**, +1 — new module `RG/MarginalUVMassGap.lean`).
Oracle (both headlines): `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

Generalizes the geometric-profile UV assembly to the marginal (YM) coupling,
the honest 4D replacement for `lattice_mass_gap_of_cluster_and_coupling`:

* **`uv_summable_summation`** — finite partial sums of `|R k| ≤ amp·w_k` are
  `≤ amp·S` for `w ≥ 0` summable with `∑' w ≤ S` (`Summable.sum_le_tsum`).
* **`lattice_mass_gap_of_per_scale_uv_summable`** — the banked geometric-profile
  assembly (`lattice_mass_gap_of_per_scale_uv`, Add. 19) generalized from `rᵏ`
  to ANY nonnegative summable `w_k`: from `|R_{t,k}| ≤ (C₂·e^{−c₀t})·w_k` (+ the
  theorem-fed IR bound + the covariance scale-sum), the lattice mass gap with
  constant `C₁ + C₂·S`.  Feeds `lattice_mass_gap_of_exp_clustering_uniform`.
* **`lattice_mass_gap_of_cluster_and_marginal_coupling`** — the headline: the
  coupling flows by the marginal recursion `g_{k+1} = g_k(1 − β g_k)`
  (asymptotically free, NOT geometric), the carried Bałaban YM activity bound
  is `|R_{t,k}| ≤ (C₂·e^{−c₀t})·g_k^{κ₀}` (`κ₀ > 1`), and the lattice mass gap
  follows with the **finite** constant `C₁ + C₂·∑_k g_k^{κ₀}` — the scale-sum
  convergent by `marginal_coupling_pow_summable_of_recursion` (Add. 62) even
  though `g_k` does not decay geometrically.

**Dependency moved.**  The §6.3 UV obligation now has an end-to-end conditional
with the **correct (marginal) YM coupling flow** — no false `g_k ≤ C·rᵏ`.  The
sole carried analytic input is `hRpoly` (the Bałaban YM single-scale activity
bound, CMP 116 Lemma 3 / Large Field II — months-scale gauge construction, NOT
formalized).  The IR side is theorem-fed; the `R_{t,k}`-as-covariance-remainder
reading is carried framing (Bałaban proves UV *stability*, not a mass gap).
**Non-vacuity:** the general `_summable` assembly is non-vacuous for any
geometric `w` (e.g. `(1/2)ᵏ`); the marginal recursion is satisfiable by the
logistic flow `g_0 = 1/2, β = 1` (stays in `(0,1/2]`).  Clay distance **~0%
(<0.1%), unchanged** — a lattice conditional, no continuum/OS content.

## Addendum 65 (2026-06-13, **non-vacuity of the marginal conditional**

FOUNDATIONS-discipline non-vacuity certificate for Add. 64's marginal
conditional (matching the geometric `lattice_mass_gap_uv_conditional_nonvacuous`,
Add. 56): the logistic flow `g_{k+1} = g_k(1 − β g_k)` with `β = 1`, `g_0 = 1/2`
satisfies all the coupling hypotheses of
`lattice_mass_gap_of_cluster_and_marginal_coupling` — positivity, smallness
`β·g_k < 1`, and the recursion — so the marginal conditional's coupling premise
is inhabited by genuine data and is NOT vacuously applicable.  Proof: the flow
stays in `(0, 1/2]` by induction (`nlinarith` + `sq_nonneg (g_n − 1/2)`); the
recursion holds definitionally (`Nat.rec`).  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%),

Thomas / Neumann engine** `YangMills.RG.expDecay_comp`; core 8258)

**Build:** green (**8258 jobs**, +1 — new module `RG/KernelDecay.lean`).
Oracle (`expDecay_comp`, `expDecay_add`): `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

The first analytic substrate toward the YM activity decay `hRpoly`.  Every
Bałaban multiscale propagator/activity bound rests on the fact that
exponentially-decaying operator kernels form a **calculus**; this file builds
it abstractly and source-independently for real kernels on a metric `(V, d)`:

* **`ExpDecay d a κ K`** := `∀ x y, |K x y| ≤ a·e^{−κ·d x y}`.
* **`expDecay_comp`** (the crux) — composition preserves decay: `A`, `B` at
  rate `κ` give `(x,y) ↦ ∑_z A x z·B z y` at rate `κ − σ`, amplitude `a·b·S`,
  using the uniform exponential summability `∑_z e^{−σ d(x,z)} ≤ S`
  (`0 ≤ σ ≤ κ`).  Triangle inequality extracts `e^{−(κ−σ)d(x,y)}`; the
  summability absorbs `e^{−σ d(x,z)}`.  This is the Combes–Thomas /
  Neumann-series engine (the resolvent/propagator of a bounded-range operator
  decays exponentially; the YM decay constant `κ` of CMP 116 Lemma 3 is
  inherited from CMP 95/99 via exactly this mechanism).
* **`expDecay_add` / `expDecay_smul` / `ExpDecay.mono`** — closure under sums,
  nonnegative scalars, amplitude/rate weakening.

**Dependency moved.**  The summability hypothesis `∑_z e^{−σ d(x,z)} ≤ S` is
exactly what `RG/AnimalTour.lean` / `RG/CubeLattice.lean` supply on the
`M`-cube graph — so this calculus is *connected* to the closed combinatorial
substrate, not free-floating.  **It does NOT prove the YM activity bound**
(the carried `hRpoly`, needing the full gauge fluctuation construction); it is
the analytic toolkit that bound's proof must consume.  **Non-vacuity:** the
composition is a genuine quantitative inequality; the hypotheses are jointly
satisfiable (any bounded-degree lattice with `d` the graph distance gives the
summability via the animal count, e.g. `cubeAdj`).  Source: Combes–Thomas,
Bałaban CMP 95/99; strategy/framing **Lluis Eriksson** (ai.viXra:2602.0088).

## Addendum 67 (2026-06-13, **fixed-rate iterated kernel composition — the
Neumann engine** `YangMills.RG.expDecay_pow`; core 8258)

**Build:** green (8258 jobs — theorems added to `RG/KernelDecay.lean`, no new
module).  Oracle (`expDecay_comp_asym`, `expDecay_pow`):
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

Extends the kernel-decay calculus (Add. 66) to the iteration needed for a
resolvent/propagator decay:

* **`expDecay_comp_asym`** — asymmetric composition: `A` at the higher rate
  `β + σ` composed with `B` at rate `β` gives `A∘B` at the **unreduced** rate
  `β` (amplitude `a·b·S`).  The extra `σ` of `A` pays for the intermediate
  summation, so the output keeps `B`'s rate — the form that iterates at a
  fixed rate.
* **`Kpow`** — the `n`-fold compositional power of a kernel.
* **`expDecay_pow`** — the Neumann engine: a kernel `K` at rate `κ` has all
  powers `Kⁿ` decaying at the **fixed** rate `κ − σ` with geometric amplitude
  `a·(a·S)ⁿ`.  Induction on `n` via `expDecay_comp_asym` (`K` at rate
  `κ = (κ−σ)+σ` ∘ `Kⁿ` at rate `κ−σ` stays at `κ−σ`).  This is the per-power
  input to `∑ₙ Kⁿ` (the resolvent `(1−K)⁻¹`): with `a·S < 1` the amplitudes
  `a·(a·S)ⁿ` are geometrically summable, giving a fixed-rate exponentially-
  decaying resolvent — the Combes–Thomas conclusion (Bałaban CMP 95/99), the
  source of the YM activity decay constant `κ`.

**Dependency moved.**  The analytic substrate now reaches the iterated/resolvent
level.  Still source-independent and still NOT the YM activity bound (carried
`hRpoly`).  **Non-vacuity:** genuine quantitative bounds; hypotheses jointly
satisfiable on any bounded-degree lattice (`cubeAdj`) via the animal-count
summability.  Continuum (M4) track; Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 68 (2026-06-13, **resolvent / Neumann decay — the Combes–Thomas
conclusion** `YangMills.RG.expDecay_resolvent`; core 8258)

**Build:** green (8258 jobs — theorem added to `RG/KernelDecay.lean`, no new
module).  Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

The capstone of the exponential-decay kernel calculus (Add. 66–67):

* **`expDecay_resolvent`** — if `K` decays at rate `κ` (amplitude `a`), the
  lattice has exponential summability `∑_z e^{−σ d(x,z)} ≤ S`, and the
  **smallness `a·S < 1`** holds, then the Neumann series
  `(1 − K)⁻¹ = ∑ₙ Kⁿ` converges to a kernel decaying at the **fixed** rate
  `κ − σ` with amplitude `a/(1 − a·S)`.  Sums `expDecay_pow` over the geometric
  amplitudes `a·(a·S)ⁿ` (`summable_geometric_of_lt_one`,
  `tsum_geometric_of_lt_one`).

This is the operator-theoretic heart of every Bałaban propagator bound — a
bounded-range, weakly-coupled operator has an **exponentially-decaying
resolvent**; the YM activity-decay constant `κ` (CMP 116 Lemma 3) is inherited
from precisely this resolvent decay of the background-field propagator
(CMP 95/99).  The kernel-decay calculus is now complete through the resolvent
level: `ExpDecay`, sum/scalar/`mono`, composition (`expDecay_comp` /
`_comp_asym`), powers (`expDecay_pow`), and resolvent (`expDecay_resolvent`) —
a coherent, source-independent analytic toolkit the YM activity bound's proof
must consume.

**Dependency moved.**  The full source-independent analytic substrate toward
`hRpoly` is now built (combinatorial summability + marginal coupling +
kernel-decay/resolvent calculus).  The remaining gap is exactly the **carried
YM activity bound** `hRpoly` itself, which requires the concrete gauge
construction (the lattice gauge-covariant Laplacian / background-field operator
as a specific `ExpDecay` instance — the months-scale CMP 95/99/109/116 work),
not further abstract substrate.  **Non-vacuity:** genuine quantitative bound;
hypotheses jointly satisfiable on `cubeAdj` with small `a`.  Clay distance
**~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 69 (2026-06-13, **Schur boundedness of decaying kernels — the
covariance face** `YangMills.RG.expDecay_quadratic_form_le`; core 8259)

**Build:** green (**8259 jobs**, +1 — new module `RG/KernelSchur.lean`).
Oracle (both): `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

The boundedness companion to the kernel-decay calculus (Add. 66–68), on a
finite lattice:

* **`expDecay_finset_row_le`** — the ℓ¹ row-sum bound `∑_y |K x y| ≤ a·S`.
* **`expDecay_quadratic_form_le`** — the finite-dimensional **Schur test**:
  an exponentially-decaying kernel (symmetric metric) gives a quadratic form
  `|∑_{x,y} u x · K x y · u y| ≤ (a·S)·∑_x (u x)²`.  Proof: `|bilinear| ≤
  ∑∑|u_x||K_xy||u_y|`, then the Schur AM–GM `2|u_x||u_y| ≤ u_x²+u_y²` and
  row/column summability (`Finset.sum_comm`).

This is exactly the shape of a **covariance bound** `Cov ≤ a·S`: a background-
field propagator with an `ExpDecay` kernel induces a covariance form controlled
by `a·S` (cf. `RG/GaussianStep.lean`, Bałaban CMP 95–96).  Source-independent,
finite-dimensional, and **volume-free** (the bound `a·S` is volume-uniform).

**Dependency moved.**  The source-independent operator/kernel/covariance
substrate toward `hRpoly` is now complete: spatial **decay** (kernel calculus +
resolvent, Add. 66–68) and **boundedness** (Schur row-sum + quadratic form,
this addendum).  Together they are the full analytic toolkit Bałaban's gauge
construction consumes to produce the YM activity bound `|H_k(X)| ≤ H₀ e^{−κ d}`.
The remaining gap is the **carried `hRpoly`** — instantiating this toolkit on
the concrete lattice gauge-covariant operator (CMP 95/99/102/109/116, months-
scale), not further abstract substrate.  **Non-vacuity:** genuine quadratic
bound; hypotheses satisfiable on any finite bounded-degree lattice (`cubeAdj`).
Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 70 (2026-06-13, **operator-norm Schur bound — the full ℓ² Schur
test** `YangMills.RG.expDecay_op_bilinear_le`; core 8259)

**Build:** green (8259 jobs — theorem added to `RG/KernelSchur.lean`, no new
module).  Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

The sharp operator-norm form of the Schur test (strengthening the
covariance/quadratic bound of Add. 69):

* **`expDecay_op_bilinear_le`** — an exponentially-decaying kernel `K`
  (symmetric metric, summability `S`) is bounded as a bilinear form by
  `a·S·‖u‖·‖v‖`: `|∑_{x,y} u x · K x y · v y| ≤ a·S·√(∑ u²)·√(∑ v²)`, i.e.
  `‖K‖_{op} ≤ a·S`.  Proof: bound by `∑∑|u_x||K_xy||v_y|`, write it as
  `∑_{(x,y)} (√|K_xy| |u_x|)(√|K_xy| |v_y|)`, apply Cauchy–Schwarz over the
  product index (`Finset.sum_mul_sq_le_sq_mul_sq`), bound the two factors by
  row/column summability (`a·S·‖u‖²`, `a·S·‖v‖²`), and take square roots.  The
  `u = v` case recovers `expDecay_quadratic_form_le`.

**Dependency moved.**  This completes the source-independent
operator/kernel/covariance substrate toward `hRpoly`: decay (`ExpDecay`,
composition, resolvent — Add. 66–68) **and** boundedness (row-sum, quadratic
form, and now the sharp operator norm — Add. 69–70).  This is the full analytic
toolkit Bałaban's gauge construction consumes; the remaining gap is the carried
`hRpoly`, i.e. exhibiting the concrete lattice gauge-covariant operator as an
`ExpDecay` instance (CMP 95/99/102/109/116, months-scale).  **Non-vacuity:**
genuine operator bound; hypotheses satisfiable on `cubeAdj`.  Clay distance
**~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 71 (2026-06-13, **PSD covariance-kernel interface** —
`YangMills.RG.psd_cauchy_schwarz` + diagonal bounds; core 8260)

**Build:** green (**8260 jobs**, +1 — new module `RG/CovarianceKernel.lean`).
Oracle (`psd_diag_nonneg`, `psd_cauchy_schwarz`): `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

The covariance layer of the `hRpoly` analytic substrate, connecting the
exponential-decay/Schur calculus to a Gaussian field's covariance:

* **`expDecay_diag_abs_le`** — the diagonal (field variance at coincident
  points) of an `ExpDecay` kernel is `≤ a` (when `d x x = 0`).
* **`IsPSDKernel K`** := `∀ u, 0 ≤ ∑_{x,y} u x K x y u y` (the covariance
  property).
* **`psd_diag_nonneg`** — a PSD kernel has nonnegative diagonal (variance ≥ 0),
  via the indicator test vector.
* **`psd_cauchy_schwarz`** — the **covariance Cauchy–Schwarz**
  `(∑ u K v)² ≤ (∑ u K u)(∑ v K v)` for a symmetric PSD kernel, via the
  discriminant of the nonnegative quadratic `t ↦ ∑ (u+t v) K (u+t v) ≥ 0`
  (`discrim_le_zero`).

**Dependency moved.**  Combined with the Schur operator-norm bound
(`expDecay_op_bilinear_le`, Add. 70), a background-field propagator that is a
symmetric PSD `ExpDecay` kernel now has: covariance form `≤ a·S`, variances
`≤ a`, the covariance Cauchy–Schwarz, and exponentially-decaying powers/
resolvent — the **complete finite-lattice covariance/operator toolkit** a
Gaussian fluctuation bound consumes.  This closes the source-independent
analytic substrate toward `hRpoly`; the remaining gap is exhibiting the
concrete lattice gauge-covariant operator as such a kernel (CMP 95/99/102/
109/116, months-scale).  **Non-vacuity:** genuine PSD-form inequalities; the
zero kernel and any Gram kernel `K x y = ⟨e_x, e_y⟩` are PSD instances.  Clay
distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 72 (2026-06-13, **Gaussian field-size / MGF bound from a covariance
bound** `YangMills.RG.gaussian_exp_integral_le`; core 8261)

**Build:** green (**8261 jobs**, +1 — new module `RG/GaussianMGF.lean`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

First brick of the **Gaussian-from-covariance layer** (new campaign): the
fluctuation-integral input that a Gaussian field with bounded covariance has
uniformly bounded exponential moments.

* **`gaussian_exp_integral_le`** — if the 1-D marginal of a centered measure
  `μ` under the linear observable `L` is `gaussianReal 0 v` (the defining
  centered-marginal property of a Gaussian field), and the variance `v ≤ B`
  (with `B = a·S·‖L‖²` the value `expDecay_quadratic_form_le` / `psd_cauchy_schwarz`
  supply), then `∫ exp(L φ) dμ ≤ exp(B/2)`.  Built directly on Mathlib's
  `mgf_gaussianReal` (the 1-D Gaussian MGF) via `mgf L μ 1 = ∫ exp(L φ)`.

**Dependency moved.**  The covariance/operator substrate (Add. 66–71) now feeds
a genuine Gaussian fluctuation bound: bounded covariance ⇒ bounded exponential
field moments, the small-field integral input.  **Honest scope:** the
hypothesis `μ.map L = gaussianReal 0 v` is the genuine centered-1-D-marginal
property (true for every Gaussian measure), a faithful carried hypothesis, NOT
a fabricated constructor.  Deriving it from an abstract `[IsGaussian μ]`
(centered, via `isGaussian_map` + the charFun characterization + the
`IsGaussian`-on-ℝ = `gaussianReal` identity) is the natural next brick.  Does
NOT prove `hRpoly`.  **Non-vacuity:** `gaussianReal 0 v` itself (with `μ = `
pushforward, `L = id`) satisfies the hypothesis.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%),
unchanged**.

## Addendum 73 (2026-06-13, **self-contained Gaussian MGF bound for an abstract
centered Gaussian** `YangMills.RG.gaussian_exp_integral_le_isGaussian`; core 8261)

**Build:** green (8261 jobs — theorem added to `RG/GaussianMGF.lean`, no new
module).  Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

Completes the prompt's target objective: the Gaussian field-size bound with
**no carried marginal hypothesis**, reduced fully to abstract Gaussianity +
centering + the variance bound.

* **`gaussian_exp_integral_le_isGaussian`** — for any `[IsGaussian μ]` on a
  separable Banach space, a centered linear observable `L` (`μ[L] = 0`) with
  bounded variance (`Var[L; μ] ≤ B`, the value `expDecay_quadratic_form_le` /
  `psd_cauchy_schwarz` supply, `B = a·S·‖L‖²`) satisfies
  `∫ exp(L φ) dμ ≤ exp(B/2)`.  Derives the 1-D marginal
  `μ.map L = gaussianReal 0 (Var[L;μ])` from Mathlib's
  `IsGaussian.map_eq_gaussianReal`, then applies `gaussian_exp_integral_le`
  (Add. 72).

**Dependency moved.**  The Gaussian-from-covariance layer is now closed at the
abstract level: *centered Gaussian + covariance bound `a·S` ⇒ exponential
field-size bound* `exp(½ a·S ‖L‖²)` — exactly the small-field fluctuation
integral input, with the covariance bound supplied by the kernel/Schur/PSD
substrate (Add. 66–71).  The full source-independent analytic toolkit toward
`hRpoly` — combinatorial summability, marginal coupling, kernel decay/resolvent,
Schur/operator boundedness, PSD covariance, and now the Gaussian MGF bound — is
in place and oracle-clean.  The remaining gap is the carried `hRpoly`:
constructing the concrete lattice gauge `IsGaussian` fluctuation measure with
its covariance the gauge-covariant propagator (an `ExpDecay`+PSD kernel) — the
months-scale CMP 95/99/102/109/116 gauge construction.  **Non-vacuity:** any
centered `gaussianReal`-type measure satisfies the hypotheses.  Clay distance
**~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 74 (2026-06-13, **the concrete multivariate Gaussian as an
`IsGaussian` measure** `YangMills.RG.isGaussian_pi` + `isGaussian_pi_map_clm`;
core 8262)

**Build:** green (**8262 jobs** — incremented from 8261 by the new module
`RG/GaussianPi.lean`).  Oracle: both `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This closes the gap flagged at the end of Add. 73 — "no constructive Gaussian
measure."  Add. 72/73 bounded the field-size integral for *any abstract*
`[IsGaussian μ]`; the open question was whether a concrete finite-dimensional
Gaussian measure exists in Mathlib as an `IsGaussian` instance.  It does not
ship one (Mathlib has 1-D `gaussianReal` and the abstract predicate, but no
multivariate Gaussian).  This module supplies the missing primitive.

* **`isGaussian_pi`** — `Measure.pi (fun i => gaussianReal (m i) (v i))` on
  `ι → ℝ` (`[Fintype ι]`), the standard multivariate Gaussian with mean `m` and
  diagonal covariance `diag v`, **is** an `IsGaussian` measure.  Proof: the
  coordinate projections are independent (`iIndepFun_pi`) and each has 1-D
  Gaussian law (`Measure.pi_map_eval` + `isGaussian_gaussianReal`), hence
  *jointly* Gaussian (Mathlib's `iIndepFun.hasGaussianLaw`); the joint law of the
  coordinates is the identity pushforward, i.e. the measure itself.

* **`isGaussian_pi_map_clm`** — pushing the standard multivariate Gaussian
  forward through **any continuous linear map** `A : (ι → ℝ) →L[ℝ] F` yields an
  `IsGaussian` measure on `F` (via `isGaussian_map_of_measurable`).  Taking `A`
  a square-root / Cholesky factor of a target PSD covariance realizes a centered
  Gaussian field with covariance bilinear form `A ∘ Aᵀ` — the constructive
  Gaussian-from-covariance object the small-field fluctuation integral integrates
  against.

**Dependency moved.**  `gaussian_exp_integral_le_isGaussian` (Add. 73) now has
concrete, non-abstract `IsGaussian` measures to consume — the field-size bound is
instantiable on a genuine constructed measure, not only on a hypothesis.  The
remaining `hRpoly` gap is now purely: (i) match `A ∘ Aᵀ` to the specific
gauge-covariant background-field propagator (`ExpDecay`+PSD kernel; Cholesky /
spectral factor + the CMP 99 propagator bound), and (ii) the full single-scale
raw-activity bound (CMP 116) — both carried as honest hypotheses, never axioms.
**Non-vacuity:** `ι := Fin n`, `m := 0`, `v := 1` gives the standard `n`-dim
Gaussian; `A := id` recovers it.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 75 (2026-06-13, **the standard multivariate Gaussian is centered +
the fully concrete field-size bound** `YangMills.RG.pi_gaussian_centered` +
`pi_gaussian_exp_integral_le`; core 8262)

**Build:** green (8262 jobs — theorems added to `RG/GaussianPi.lean`, no new
module).  Oracle: both `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This ties Add. 74 (`isGaussian_pi`) to Add. 73 (the abstract field-size bound),
turning the latter from hypothesis-fed into instantiated-on-an-explicit-measure.

* **`pi_gaussian_centered`** — for `μ = Measure.pi (fun i => gaussianReal 0 vᵢ)`
  and any dual `L`, `μ[L] = 0`.  Proof by symmetry: each `gaussianReal 0 vᵢ` is
  `x ↦ -x`-invariant (`gaussianReal_map_neg` + `neg_zero`), so the product
  measure is (`Measure.pi_map_pi`); hence `μ[L] = μ[L∘(-·)] = -μ[L]`
  (`L` linear; `IsGaussian.integrable_dual` for integrability), so `μ[L] = 0`.

* **`pi_gaussian_exp_integral_le`** — the capstone: for the centered standard
  multivariate Gaussian and any dual `L` with `Var[L;μ] ≤ B`,
  `∫ exp(L φ) dμ ≤ exp(B/2)`.  This is `gaussian_exp_integral_le_isGaussian`
  (Add. 73) instantiated via `isGaussian_pi` + `pi_gaussian_centered` — a fully
  concrete, non-vacuous fluctuation-integral bound on a genuine constructed
  measure (no abstract `IsGaussian` hypothesis, no carried centering).

The abstract Gaussian-from-covariance layer is now end-to-end concrete: construct
`μ` (`isGaussian_pi`), it is centered (`pi_gaussian_centered`), and bounded
covariance gives the field-size bound (`pi_gaussian_exp_integral_le`); the
kernel/Schur/PSD substrate (Add. 66–71) supplies `Var[L;μ] ≤ a·S·‖L‖²`.  The
remaining `hRpoly` gap is unchanged: the concrete gauge-covariant propagator
(CMP 99) realizing the covariance, and the CMP 116 single-scale raw-activity
bound — both carried as honest hypotheses.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%),
unchanged**.

## Addendum 76 (2026-06-13, **the variance bridge: covariance form of the
product Gaussian computed + the Schur→variance→MGF connection**
`YangMills.RG.pi_gaussian_variance` + `_of_covariance_sum` +
`_of_uniform_variance`; core 8262)

**Build:** green (8262 jobs — theorems added to `RG/GaussianPi.lean`, no new
module).  Oracle: all three `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

Closes the bridge flagged at the end of Add. 75: the covariance form of the
constructed Gaussian is now *computed*, not abstract, and wired to the
field-size bound — realizing the chain *(uniform) covariance bound → variance
bound → field-size/MGF bound* on a genuine constructed measure.

* **`pi_gaussian_variance`** — for `μ = Measure.pi (fun i => gaussianReal 0 vᵢ)`
  and any dual `L`, `Var[L; μ] = ∑ᵢ (L eᵢ)²·vᵢ` (`eᵢ = Pi.single i 1`).  Proof:
  `L = ∑ᵢ (L eᵢ)·(·ᵢ)` (`Finset.univ_sum_single` + linearity); coordinates are
  independent (`iIndepFun_pi`) and `L²`-integrable (`IsGaussian.memLp_dual`), so
  `Var` of the sum splits (`IndepFun.variance_sum`); each term is
  `(L eᵢ)²·Var[(·ᵢ)] = (L eᵢ)²·vᵢ` (`variance_const_mul` +
  `variance_id_gaussianReal` via the coordinate marginal `Measure.pi_map_eval`).

* **`pi_gaussian_exp_integral_le_of_covariance_sum`** — `∑ᵢ (L eᵢ)²·vᵢ ≤ B ⟹
  ∫ exp(L φ) dμ ≤ exp(B/2)` (substitute the computed variance into Add. 75's
  bound): the "variance bound ⟹ MGF" link with the variance *computed*.

* **`pi_gaussian_exp_integral_le_of_uniform_variance`** — `vᵢ ≤ a` (uniform
  covariance bound) `⟹ ∫ exp(L φ) dμ ≤ exp(a·(∑ᵢ (L eᵢ)²)/2)`.  The small-field
  fluctuation-integral input in canonical shape `exp(½ a·‖·‖²)`; the `a·S` of the
  Schur bound (`expDecay_quadratic_form_le` / `psd_cauchy_schwarz`, Add. 69–71)
  plugs directly into `a`.

The diagonal product-Gaussian covariance is now end-to-end concrete and connected
to the kernel/Schur substrate.  The off-diagonal (general PSD) covariance remains
via the `A`-pushforward (`isGaussian_pi_map_clm`, Add. 74) with `A∘Aᵀ = C` — the
Cholesky/spectral-factor step, still ahead.  The `hRpoly` gap is unchanged: the
concrete CMP-99 gauge-covariant propagator realizing `C`, and the CMP-116
single-scale raw-activity bound — carried as honest hypotheses, never axioms.
Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 77 (2026-06-13, **general / off-diagonal covariance via the
A-pushforward** `YangMills.RG.pi_gaussian_map_variance` +
`pi_gaussian_map_exp_integral_le`; core 8262)

**Build:** green (8262 jobs — theorems added to `RG/GaussianPi.lean`, no new
module).  Oracle: both `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

Lifts Add. 76 from the diagonal product Gaussian to an *arbitrary* constructed
Gaussian covariance `A∘Aᵀ` — the realistic shape of the Bałaban fluctuation
propagator (off-diagonal in general).

* **`pi_gaussian_map_variance`** — for `A : (ι → ℝ) →L[ℝ] F` and a dual `L` on
  `F`, `Var[L; μ.map A] = ∑ᵢ (L (A eᵢ))²·vᵢ`.  Proof: `variance_map` reduces to
  `Var[L∘A; μ]`, then `pi_gaussian_variance` on the composite dual `L∘L A`.

* **`pi_gaussian_map_exp_integral_le`** — for the field `μ.map A` and any dual
  `L` with `∑ᵢ (L (A eᵢ))²·vᵢ ≤ B`, `∫ exp(L φ) d(μ.map A) ≤ exp(B/2)`.  Centering
  transported through `A` (`pi_gaussian_centered` on `L∘L A`), variance the
  explicit form above — the small-field bound for an arbitrary (off-diagonal)
  constructed Gaussian covariance.

The Gaussian-from-covariance layer is now complete at the constructed level:
build the standard Gaussian (`isGaussian_pi`), push through any factor `A`
(`isGaussian_pi_map_clm`), it is centered (`pi_gaussian_centered` transported),
its covariance form is explicit (`pi_gaussian_map_variance`), and a bound on that
form gives the field-size bound (`pi_gaussian_map_exp_integral_le`).  The only
remaining step to a fully-realized fluctuation field is matching `A∘Aᵀ` to the
concrete CMP-99 gauge-covariant propagator (the Cholesky / spectral-factor +
propagator-bound step) and the CMP-116 single-scale raw-activity bound — both
carried as honest hypotheses, never axioms.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%),
unchanged**.

## Addendum 78 (2026-06-13, **the faithful closure: ExpDecay covariance kernel ⟹
Gaussian field-size bound** `YangMills.RG.pi_gaussian_map_variance_quadratic` +
`pi_gaussian_map_exp_integral_le_of_expDecay`; core 8262)

**Build:** green (8262 jobs — theorems added to `RG/GaussianPi.lean`; the module
now also imports `RG/KernelSchur.lean`).  Oracle: both
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This is the end-to-end join of the two independent substrates built this session:
the kernel decay / Schur test (`RG/KernelDecay.lean`, `RG/KernelSchur.lean`,
Add. 53–71) and the constructed Gaussian field (`RG/GaussianPi.lean`,
Add. 74–77).  *An exponentially-decaying covariance kernel now provably yields the
small-field fluctuation bound on a genuine constructed Gaussian.*

* **`pi_gaussian_map_variance_quadratic`** — the covariance of the transformed
  field is the Gram quadratic form of its kernel:
  `Var[L; μ.map A] = ∑ₓ∑ᵧ cₓ·Kₓᵧ·cᵧ` with `Kₓᵧ = ∑ᵢ vᵢ·(A eᵢ)ₓ·(A eᵢ)ᵧ`,
  `cₓ = L eₓ`.  Proof: expand `L(A eᵢ) = ∑ₓ (A eᵢ)ₓ·cₓ`, square via
  `Finset.sum_mul_sum`, reorganize the triple sum (`Finset.sum_comm`).  Puts the
  covariance into the exact shape `expDecay_quadratic_form_le` consumes.

* **`pi_gaussian_map_exp_integral_le_of_expDecay`** — the closure: if the Gram
  covariance kernel `K` is `ExpDecay d a κ K` (symmetric metric, row-sum `≤ S`),
  then `∫ exp(L z) d(μ.map A) ≤ exp(a·S·(∑ₓ (L eₓ)²)/2)`.  Variance = kernel
  quadratic form (above) `≤ a·S·∑cₓ²` by the finite-dimensional Schur test
  (`expDecay_quadratic_form_le`, Add. 69), feeding the field-size bound
  (`pi_gaussian_map_exp_integral_le`, Add. 77).  The decay constants `(a, κ, S)`
  are exactly those a Combes–Thomas / gauge-propagator analysis supplies.

The Gaussian-fluctuation toolkit is now complete and self-joined: *ExpDecay
covariance kernel ⟹ Schur quadratic-form bound ⟹ variance bound ⟹ field-size /
MGF bound*, all on an explicitly constructed Gaussian measure, zero axioms.  The
sole remaining input to instantiate it on the real Bałaban fluctuation field is
the concrete CMP-99 gauge-covariant propagator (showing its kernel is `ExpDecay`
with the right `κ`) and the CMP-116 single-scale raw-activity bound — carried as
honest hypotheses, never axioms.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 79 (2026-06-13, **the constructed Gram covariance kernel is PSD**
`YangMills.RG.gram_kernel_isPSDKernel`; core 8262)

**Build:** green (8262 jobs — theorem added to `RG/GaussianPi.lean`; module now
also imports `RG/CovarianceKernel.lean`).  Oracle:
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

Coherence / non-vacuity capstone of the Gaussian layer: the Gram covariance
kernel `Kₓᵧ = ∑ᵢ vᵢ·(A eᵢ)ₓ·(A eᵢ)ᵧ` of the transformed field `μ.map A` is a
genuine `IsPSDKernel` (`RG/CovarianceKernel.lean`, Add. 71) — every quadratic
form `∑ₓ∑ᵧ uₓ·Kₓᵧ·uᵧ ≥ 0`.  This certifies the Gram construction always realizes
a *valid* covariance, tying the constructed Gaussian to the PSD-kernel interface
(`psd_diag_nonneg`, `psd_cauchy_schwarz`).  Slick proof: any coefficient vector
`u` is realized by the dual `L = ∑ₓ uₓ·projₓ` (so `L eₓ = uₓ`), whence the
quadratic form equals `Var[L; μ.map A] ≥ 0`
(`pi_gaussian_map_variance_quadratic` + `variance_nonneg`).

The Gaussian-from-covariance layer (`RG/GaussianPi.lean`) is now a closed,
self-consistent toolkit: construct (`isGaussian_pi`), transform
(`isGaussian_pi_map_clm`), centered (`pi_gaussian_centered`), covariance is a
valid PSD kernel (`gram_kernel_isPSDKernel`) computed as a quadratic form
(`pi_gaussian_map_variance_quadratic`), and an ExpDecay covariance kernel gives
the field-size bound (`pi_gaussian_map_exp_integral_le_of_expDecay`).  The only
remaining input is the concrete CMP-99 gauge propagator (its kernel `ExpDecay`)
and the CMP-116 raw-activity bound — carried hypotheses, never axioms.  Clay
distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 80 (2026-06-13, **finite-range ⟹ ExpDecay: the operator-level
Combes–Thomas input** `YangMills.RG.finiteRange_isExpDecay`; core 8262)

**Build:** green (8262 jobs — theorem added to `RG/KernelDecay.lean`, no new
module).  Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

Opens the concrete-propagator track.  Until now the `ExpDecay` calculus
(composition, powers, resolvent — Add. 53–56) and the field-size bound
(Add. 78) consumed `ExpDecay` kernels *hypothetically*.  This supplies the first
concrete source of them.

* **`finiteRange_isExpDecay`** — a kernel `K` of finite range `R`
  (`K x y = 0` whenever `d x y > R`) and bounded by `M` is `ExpDecay d (M·e^{κR}) κ K`
  for *any* rate `κ ≥ 0`.  On the support `e^{-κ d} ≥ e^{-κR}` absorbs the
  constant; off it `K = 0`.  Hence every finite-range lattice operator — the
  nearest-neighbour Laplacian, the Wilson hopping term, the background-field
  covariant difference operator — is `ExpDecay`, and by `expDecay_comp` /
  `expDecay_pow` / `expDecay_resolvent` its resolvent (the lattice propagator) is
  too.  Composed with `gram_kernel_isPSDKernel` +
  `pi_gaussian_map_exp_integral_le_of_expDecay` (Add. 78–79), this is the
  concrete origin of the exponentially-decaying Gaussian covariance the
  fluctuation integral needs.

This reduces the gauge-propagator obstruction to two faithful, source-grounded
facts: (i) the concrete Bałaban background-field covariant operator is
finite-range (immediate from its definition) so its inverse on the small-field
region is `ExpDecay` via the resolvent series, and (ii) the CMP-116 single-scale
raw-activity bound — both carried as honest hypotheses, never axioms.  Clay
distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 81 (2026-06-13, **the resolvent of a small finite-range operator
decays exponentially — concrete Combes–Thomas**
`YangMills.RG.finiteRange_resolvent_isExpDecay`; core 8262)

**Build:** green (8262 jobs — theorem added to `RG/KernelDecay.lean`).  Oracle:
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

The single composite that turns the abstract resolvent calculus into the literal
mechanism of the Bałaban propagator bound.

* **`finiteRange_resolvent_isExpDecay`** — a finite-range kernel `K` (range `R`,
  bound `M`), small enough that `M·e^{κR}·S < 1` for some rate `κ > σ` (with
  `∑_z e^{−σ d(x,z)} ≤ S`), has Neumann-series resolvent
  `(1 − K)⁻¹ = ∑ₙ Kⁿ` that is `ExpDecay` at the *positive* rate `κ − σ`, with
  amplitude `M·e^{κR}/(1 − M·e^{κR}·S)`.  Pure composition of
  `finiteRange_isExpDecay` (Add. 80: range ⇒ decay at any rate) with
  `expDecay_resolvent` (Add. 56: decay + smallness ⇒ resolvent decay).

This is exactly how the YM activity-decay constant `κ` (CMP 116 Lemma 3) arises:
the background-field covariant difference operator is finite-range, and its
inverse — the propagator (CMP 95/99) — inherits exponential decay from this
resolvent estimate.  The chain is now concrete end-to-end at the *operator* level:
**finite-range operator ⇒ resolvent ExpDecay ⇒ (Gram) covariance ExpDecay ⇒ Schur
quadratic-form bound ⇒ Gaussian field-size bound**.  The remaining inputs are the
two faithful source facts — the concrete operator's finite range / small-field
smallness (CMP 95/99) and the CMP-116 raw-activity bound — carried as honest
hypotheses, never axioms.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 82 (2026-06-13, **volume-uniform lattice exponential summability from
a shell-growth bound** `YangMills.RG.lattice_exp_sum_le_of_shell`; core 8262)

**Build:** green (8262 jobs — theorem added to `RG/KernelDecay.lean`).  Oracle:
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

Discharges the *recurring* geometric hypothesis of the entire decay stack — the
summability `∑_z e^{−σ d(x,z)} ≤ S` consumed (as `hsum`/`hS`/`hrow`) by
`expDecay_comp`, `expDecay_resolvent`, `finiteRange_resolvent_isExpDecay`, and
`expDecay_quadratic_form_le`.

* **`lattice_exp_sum_le_of_shell`** — if the shell cardinalities
  `#{z : ℓ z = k}` (with `ℓ` the graph distance from a fixed point) are bounded by
  `N k`, and `∑ₖ N k · e^{−σk}` is summable, then
  `∑_z e^{−σ·ℓ z} ≤ ∑'ₖ N k · e^{−σk}` — a bound **independent of the lattice
  size**.  On `ℤ^d` the shells grow polynomially (`N k = C·(k+1)^{d−1}`), so the
  dominating series is polynomial × geometric, finite for every `σ > 0`: this is
  the geometric origin of the uniform summability constant `S` in the
  Combes–Thomas / Bałaban propagator estimates.  Proof: group into shells
  (`Finset.sum_fiberwise_of_maps_to`), bound each shell by `N k`, compare the
  finite shell-sum to the full series (`Summable.sum_le_tsum`).

With this, the decay-and-fluctuation substrate is geometrically self-contained:
the lattice geometry supplies `S`, finite-range operators are `ExpDecay`
(Add. 80), their resolvents decay (Add. 81), the resulting Gram covariance is PSD
(Add. 79) and its quadratic form is Schur-bounded (Add. 69), giving the Gaussian
field-size bound (Add. 78).  The remaining inputs are the two faithful source
facts — the concrete Bałaban operator's finite range / smallness (CMP 95/99) and
the CMP-116 raw-activity bound — carried as honest hypotheses, never axioms.
Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 83 (2026-06-14, **explicit geometric shell constant**
`YangMills.RG.lattice_exp_sum_le_geometric`; core 8262)

**Build:** green (theorem added to `RG/KernelDecay.lean`).  Oracle:
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

Specializes Addendum 82 to the bounded-degree / geometric-shell form most
directly consumed by the Combes–Thomas constants.

* **`lattice_exp_sum_le_geometric`** — if
  `#{z : ℓ z = k} ≤ C·r^k` and the exponential rate beats the shell growth,
  `r·exp(-σ) < 1`, then

      ∑_z exp(-σ·ℓ z) ≤ C · (1 - r·exp(-σ))⁻¹.

This packages the uniform summability constant `S` in closed form, rather than
leaving it as an abstract `∑'_k N k·exp(-σk)`.  It is the exact bounded-degree
lattice version used by the finite-range resolvent and Schur bounds: shell
growth supplies `r`; decay supplies `exp(-σ)`; the smallness condition is the
ordinary geometric-series condition.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 84 (2026-06-14, **repository coherence hardening**; current-state
docs + RG axiom-scan coverage; core 8262)

No new theorem was added in this checkpoint.  The improvement is
certification/reproducibility:

* added `CURRENT-STATE.md` as the short live entry point;
* updated README / frontier / roadmap / handoff docs from the stale
  `hRpoly`+`hg` frontier to the current `hRpoly` frontier, with the
  marginal-coupling and summability scaffolding recorded as theorem-fed;
* updated live build-count references to **8262 jobs**;
* corrected `YangMillsCore.lean` comments so the modern clean `YangMills/RG/**`
  layer is not confused with the excluded legacy Balaban-RG packet;
* extended `scripts/check_consistency.py` so verified-core axiom scanning now
  includes `YangMills/RG`.

## Addendum 85 (2026-06-18, **off-diagonal matrix-coefficient vanishing
repaired back into the verified core**
`YangMills.ClayCore.sunHaarProb_entry_offdiag`; core 8263)

**Build:** green (the bit-rotted `ClayCore/SchurEntryOffDiag.lean`, excluded
since the 2026-05 cleanup, repaired and re-imported by `YangMillsCore`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

The module states the Schur off-diagonal entry-orthogonality
**L2.6 step 1b-ii**:

* **`sunHaarProb_entry_offdiag`** — for `i ≠ k`,

      ∫ U, U.val i j * star (U.val k l) ∂(sunHaarProb N) = 0.

  This generalizes the on-diagonal / off-diagonal entry vanishing already in
  the core (`SchurEntryOrthogonality`, `SchurEntryNAlitySelection`) to
  *arbitrary* column indices `j, l`: any matrix-coefficient pair with distinct
  **row** indices has zero Haar mean. This is the row-index half of the
  Schur-orthogonality structure (node F4 in `HORIZON.md`): together with the
  N-ality selection rules it is the algebraic engine of the area law's kill
  mechanism, and a stepping stone toward the full `∫ U_{ij} conj(U_{kl}) =
  (1/N) δ_{ik} δ_{jl}`.

**What bit-rotted and how it was repaired.** Three Mathlib-v4.29 elaboration
seams had broken the file:

1. `rw [star_mul]` was ambiguous on `ℂ` (both the `StarMul` reverse-order law
   `star_mul` and its commutative variant `star_mul'` apply). Repaired by
   computing the conjugation through the explicit ring endomorphism,
   `show (starRingEnd ℂ) (a*b) = _` then `(starRingEnd ℂ).map_mul` + `mul_comm`,
   following the idiom already used in `SchurDiagPhase` (`star_I_mul_ofReal`).
2. `Filter.EventuallyEq.of_forall` is no longer a public name. Repaired by
   carrying the invariance through `MeasureTheory.integral_mul_left_eq_self`
   + `funext` instead of `integral_congr_ae` + `EventuallyEq.of_forall`,
   following the idiom of `SchurZeroMean.sunHaarProb_trace_complex_integral_zero`.
3. `sunHaarProb N` requires `[NeZero N]`; the original left it implicit.
   Repaired by adding `[NeZero N]` to the headline theorem (the auxiliary
   lemmas need only `Fin N`).

The mathematics is unchanged (left-invariance of Haar against `piAntiSymSU i k`,
whose phase factor is `exp(I·π) = -1`, forces `I₀ = -I₀`, hence `I₀ = 0`); only
the proof scripts were hardened against the rename/ambiguity. The module is
re-imported by `YangMillsCore` (the `NOTE: bit-rotted` guard is removed), the
build job count incremented **8262 → 8263**, and the headline is wired into
`oracle_check.lean`.

**Honest scope.** This is lattice-side SU(N) Haar algebra, one step of the
character-orthogonality programme toward F4 (which itself is downstream of
Peter–Weyl, still not in Mathlib). It discharges *no* `hRpoly`/§6.3/continuum
obligation; Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 86 (2026-06-18, **polymer modified metric combinatorial core**
`YangMills.RG.walk_crosses_frontier` and `YangMills.RG.absorbedHole_touches_skeleton_single`; core 8264)

**Build:** green (the new module `YangMills/RG/ModifiedMetric.lean` added and imported by `YangMillsCore`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum closes the combinatorial core of the polymer-with-holes campaign brick **P2b-i**:

* **`walk_crosses_frontier`** — a walk staying inside `A ∪ B` that starts in `A \ B` and ends in `B \ A` must contain an edge crossing from `A` to `B`.
* **`absorbedHole_touches_skeleton_single`** — for a walk-connected polymer `Y ∪ H₀` composed of skeleton `Y` and a single disjoint absorbed hole `H₀`, the hole `H₀` must touch the skeleton `Y` via a `cubeAdj`-edge.

**How compilation was resolved.** The initial implementation relied on a nonexistent `SimpleGraph.Walk.exists_cons_of_not_nil` decomposition lemma, which caused compilation errors under Mathlib v4.29. This was replaced with a direct induction proof using a strong induction recursor on the walk length (`n`) combined with `match p with` and the explicit recursor constructor pattern `@Walk.cons`. The induction variables were generalized, and the `omega` linter was assisted by rewriting the definition of `Walk.length_cons` explicitly to resolve inequality proofs.

**Honest scope.** This is purely combinatorial lattice geometry, providing the walk-based topological lemma for single-hole absorption (Dimock II (arXiv:1212.5562) Section 5, Lemma \label{summit}). It does not resolve any multi-hole configurations or the analytic Gaussian suppressions of the holes. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 87 (2026-06-18, **multi-hole skeleton touching and multiplicity bounds**
`YangMills.RG.absorbedHole_touches_skeleton_multi` and `YangMills.RG.touchingHoles_card_le`; core 8264)

**Build:** green (multiplicity bounds and associated theorems added to `ModifiedMetric.lean`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum closes the multi-hole combinatorial bounds of the polymer-with-holes campaign brick **P2b-ii-a**:

* **`absorbedHole_touches_skeleton_multi`** — in a connected polymer with multiple disjoint holes having no adjacency edges between them, every absorbed hole must share a boundary edge with the skeleton.
* **`touchingHoles_card_le`** — the number of absorbed holes touching the skeleton $Y$ is at most $\Delta \cdot |Y|$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the adjacency graph.

**How compilation was resolved.**
1. To ensure all typeclass resolutions remain clean and constructive, we annotated the type parameter `(H₀ : Finset V)` explicitly inside the `touchingHoles` filter predicate. This allowed Lean to constructively synthesize decidability of the bounded existential properties without relying on noncomputable axioms.
2. In the `card_neighborPairs` proof, the `subst` tactic was bypassed by obtaining elementwise projections from the tuple equality `(x, a) = (x1, x2)` and showing `x = y` through a chain of rewrites (`hx1, h1, ← hy1`), avoiding complex unification issues.
3. In `touchingHoles_card_le`, we resolved the `Nat.cast` type coercion issue in the sum-majorant inequality by explicitly adding `Nat.cast_id` to the `simp only` list, simplifying the cast term `↑(#Y) * Δ` directly to `#Y * Δ`.
4. In the empty-vertex case, the contradiction was solved by simplifying the membership predicate to `False` and using `(hV ⟨x⟩).elim` under `¬ Nonempty V`.

## Scope statement (the honest line)

Everything above is **lattice, finite-volume, M3-side**.  None of it reduces
any M4/M5/Clay obstruction (continuum limit, OS/Wightman reconstruction,
continuum mass gap — open mathematics).  Distance to the Clay prize:
**~0% (<0.1%), unchanged.**

## Addendum 88 (2026-06-18, **active-edge cardinality bound for connected sets**
`YangMills.RG.card_le_activeEdges_add_one`; core 8264)

**Build:** green (active-edge cardinality bound added to `ModifiedMetric.lean`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum completes the active-edge cardinality bound for connected sets:

* **`card_le_activeEdges_add_one`** — For any connected vertex set `S` in a graph `G`, its cardinality is bounded by the number of active edges in `S` plus 1: $|S| \leq |E(G[S])| + 1$.

**How compilation was resolved.**
1. We resolved a walk support type mismatch in `walkConnected_of_walk_from_root` by using `List.mem_reverse` for the reversed walk support and implementing a self-contained helper `mem_of_mem_tail` to convert membership in `List.tail` to list membership.
2. We fixed the `Sym2.mk` constructor arity mismatch where `Sym2.mk` expects two arguments (`Sym2.mk p u` via notation `s(p, u)`) instead of a pair tuple `Sym2.mk (p, u)`.
3. We assisted the `omega` solver by explicitly adding `h_card_erase : S'.card = S.card - 1` using `card_erase_of_mem huS` to the context, which allowed `omega` to linearly solve the cardinality induction step without encountering non-linear subtraction issues.
4. We cleaned up the unused variable warning for `hr` in `walkConnected_of_walk_from_root` and updated the calling code.

**Honest scope.** This is purely combinatorial lattice geometry, providing a cardinality bound for connected sets. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.


## Addendum 89 (2026-06-18, **polymer modified metric definition and properties**
`YangMills.RG.discreteModifiedMetric`, `YangMills.RG.skeleton_card_le_discreteModifiedMetric_add_one`, and `YangMills.RG.discreteModifiedMetric_empty_holes`; core 8264)

**Build:** green (modified metric and associated theorems added to `ModifiedMetric.lean`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum formalises the polymer modified metric definition and its basic combinatorial properties, marking progress on **P2b-ii-b-1**:

* **`discreteModifiedMetric`** — The discrete modified metric $d_M(X, \bmod H)$ defined as the Steiner tree length of the skeleton. To ensure classical decidability of the existential properties, we used a `by classical` block in its definition.
* **`skeleton_card_le_discreteModifiedMetric_add_one`** — Proves that the cardinality of the skeleton is bounded by the modified metric plus 1: $|\text{skeleton } H\ X| \leq d_M(X, \bmod H) + 1$.
* **`discreteModifiedMetric_empty_holes`** — Proves that when the hole family $H$ has no holes, the modified metric simplifies to the standard bulk tree metric: $d_M(X, \bmod \emptyset) = |X| - 1$.

**How compilation was resolved.**
We used `Nat.sInf_mem` to extract the minimal connected vertex set $S$ spanning the skeleton, and verified that its card is related to the modified metric. For `discreteModifiedMetric_empty_holes`, we showed that when holes are empty, the set of connected sets containing the skeleton and contained in $X$ is the singleton $\{X\}$. We then proved that the `sInf` of a singleton $\{x\}$ equals $x$ by utilizing `Nat.sInf_mem` and `Set.mem_singleton_iff`.

**Honest scope.** This is purely combinatorial lattice geometry, defining the modified metric and its skeleton cardinality bound. It does not resolve the analytic Gaussian suppressions of the holes required for full summability. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.


## Addendum 90 (2026-06-18, **multi-hole polymer fillings multiplicity bounds**
`YangMills.RG.fillings_card_le_two_pow` and `YangMills.RG.cube_fillings_card_le_two_pow`; core 8264)

**Build:** green (fillings bounds added to `ModifiedMetric.lean`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum completes the multi-hole polymer multiplicity bounds, marking progress on **P2b-ii-b-2**:

* **`admissibleFillings`** — Defines the set of connected, hole-respecting polymers with a fixed skeleton Y.
* **`fillings_card_le_two_pow`** — Proves that the number of admissible fillings is bounded by $2^{\Delta \cdot |Y|}$.
* **`cube_fillings_card_le_two_pow`** — Proves the corresponding $2^{3^d \cdot |Y|}$ bound on the d-dimensional cube lattice.

**How compilation was resolved.**
We defined the injection from admissible fillings to subsets of touching holes using `absorbedHoles`. By proving injectivity of this mapping (`admissibleFillings_inj`) and leveraging the cardinality of the powerset, we bounded the number of fillings by $2^{|\text{touching holes}|}$ and combined it with the touching holes cardinality bound `touchingHoles_card_le` to yield $2^{\Delta \cdot |Y|}$.

**Honest scope.** This is purely combinatorial lattice geometry, bounding the number of polymers corresponding to a skeleton. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.


## Addendum 91 (2026-06-18, **discrete modified metric comparison bounds**
`YangMills.RG.discreteModifiedMetric_le_bulkTreeLength`, `YangMills.RG.discreteModifiedMetric_mono_skeleton`, and `YangMills.RG.discreteModifiedMetric_mono_holes`; core 8264)

**Build:** green (metric comparison theorems added to `ModifiedMetric.lean`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum formalises the source-faithful comparison bounds for the discrete modified metric, marking progress on **P2b-ii-b-3**:

* **`discreteModifiedMetric_le_bulkTreeLength`** — Proves that the discrete modified metric is bounded above by the standard bulk tree metric: $d_M(X, \bmod H) \leq |X| - 1$ for connected $X$.
* **`discreteModifiedMetric_mono_skeleton`** — Proves that a larger skeleton $Y_1 \subseteq Y_2$ (for a fixed polymer $X$) yields a larger metric: $d_M(X, \bmod H_1) \leq d_M(X, \bmod H_2)$ when $\text{skeleton } H_1\ X \subseteq \text{skeleton } H_2\ X$.
* **`discreteModifiedMetric_mono_holes`** — Proves that more holes $H_1.holes \subseteq H_2.holes$ (which reduces the skeleton size) yields a smaller metric: $d_M(X, \bmod H_2) \leq d_M(X, \bmod H_1)$.

**How compilation was resolved.**
We proved that $X$ itself is a valid candidate for the Steiner tree spanning the skeleton, which immediately bounds the `sInf` of Steiner tree lengths by $|X| - 1$. For the monotonicity theorems, we showed that if $Y_1 \subseteq Y_2 \subseteq X$, any valid connected set $S$ spanning $Y_2$ also spans $Y_1$. Thus, the set of spanning tree lengths of $Y_2$ is a subset of the set of spanning tree lengths of $Y_1$. We then leveraged `Nat.sInf_le` and `Nat.sInf_mem` to prove the inequalities, avoiding typeclass synthesis or constructive decidability errors by working with classical decidability locally inside the proofs.

**Honest scope.** This is purely combinatorial lattice geometry, establishing discrete comparison bounds for the modified metric. It does not construct the continuum tree-length metric from first principles. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.


## Addendum 92 (2026-06-18, **skeleton-fillings multiplicity bound**
`YangMills.RG.skeleton_fillings_weight_summable`; core 8264)

**Build:** green (preliminary bound added to `ModifiedMetric.lean`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum formalises the preliminary combinatorial estimate for fillings multiplicity over skeletons (progress on **P2b-ii-c**):

* **`skeleton_fillings_weight_summable`** — Proves that the polymer sum over all connected skeletons $Y$ containing a fixed root $r$ of the fillings card multiplied by the exponential metric weight $q^{|Y|}$ converges and is bounded by a volume-independent constant:
  $$\sum'_{Y \ni r} |admissibleFillings(Y)| \cdot q^{|Y|} \leq (1 - 3^{2d} \cdot q \cdot 2^{3^d})^{-1}$$
  under the coordination entropy-suppression condition.

**How compilation was resolved.**
We bounded the filling multiplicity term using `cube_fillings_card_le_two_pow` (yielding $2^{3^d \cdot |Y|}$) and combined it with the metric factor $q^{|Y|}$ into a single unified base $q' = q \cdot 2^{3^d}$. The resulting sum was then majorized by the standard lattice polymer sum using `Summable.tsum_le_tsum` and bounded using `cube_polymer_summable`. Finiteness of the index type was used to discharge the summability premise via `Summable.of_finite`.

**Honest scope.** This is purely combinatorial lattice geometry, proving that the skeleton-growth series converges under sufficient exponential suppression. It is a preliminary combinatorial estimate, not the modified-metric summability itself. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.


## Addendum 93 (2026-06-18, **discrete modified-metric summability**
`YangMills.RG.discreteModifiedMetric_weight_summable`; core 8264)

**Build:** green (the genuine modified-metric summability theorem added to `ModifiedMetric.lean`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum proves the genuine discrete modified-metric summability on the cube lattice, closing **P2b-ii-d**:

* **`discreteModifiedMetric_weight_summable`** — Proves that the polymer sum over all connected, hole-respecting polymers $X$ containing a fixed root $r$ in their skeleton, weighted by the exponential metric decay $q^{d_M(X, \bmod H) + 1}$, converges and is bounded by a volume-independent constant:
  $$\sum'_{X : r \in \text{skel } X} q^{d_M(X, \bmod H) + 1} \leq (1 - 3^{2d} \cdot q \cdot 2^{3^d + 1})^{-1}$$
  under the coordination entropy-suppression condition.

**How compilation was resolved.**
We grouped the polymer sum fiberwise over their connected minimal spanning sets $S$ using `exists_minimal_spanning_set` to associate each polymer $X$ with a spanning set $S$ of cardinality $d_M(X, \bmod H) + 1$. By partitioning the sum via `Finset.sum_fiberwise_of_maps_to`, the multiplicity of polymers matching a given spanning set $S$ was bounded by the powerset of $S$ times the maximum fillings of each subset, yielding $2^{(3^d + 1)|S|}$. The resulting sum was then majorized by the standard lattice polymer sum with base $q' = q \cdot 2^{3^d + 1}$ and bounded using `cube_polymer_summable`. All summability premises were discharged via `Summable.of_finite` over the finite torus.

**Honest scope.** This is purely combinatorial lattice geometry, establishing the discrete modified-metric summability on the cube lattice. It does not resolve the analytic Gaussian suppressions of the holes or the continuum limit. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.


## Addendum 94 (2026-06-18, **holes-respected polymer system instantiation**
`YangMills.RG.holePolymerSystem`; core 8265)

**Build:** green (instantiation added to `HolePolymerSystem.lean`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum instantiates the abstract `KP.PolymerSystem` for the holes-respected polymer family on the cube lattice, marking progress toward **P3**:

* **`holePolymerSystem`** — Defines the polymer system with nonempty, connected finsets of cubes respecting the hole family $H$, with overlap as the incompatibility relation.
* **`Fintype` instance** — Synthesized classically to establish that the polymer type is finite on the torus, allowing full compatibility with the existing KP expansion and convergence theorems.

**How compilation was resolved.**
We proved self-incompatibility via `Finset.disjoint_left.mp` on a nonempty witness, and established the Fintype instance by introducing `attribute [local instance] Classical.propDecidable` and carrying the torus positivity constraint `[NeZero L]`. The instance and constructor were marked as `noncomputable` due to the classical choice axiom dependency.

**Honest scope.** This is a structural instantiation of the polymer system framework on the lattice. It does not prove the analytical Gaussian activity bounds for the renormalization group or the continuum limit. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.


## Addendum 95 (2026-06-18, **discrete modified metric degenerate cases regression testing**
`YangMills.RG.discreteModifiedMetric_d_zero` and `YangMills.RG.discreteModifiedMetric_L_one`; core 8265)

**Build:** green (regression lemmas added to `ModifiedMetric.lean`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum completes the boundary-case testing of the discrete modified metric:

* **`discreteModifiedMetric_d_zero`** — Proves that when $d = 0$, the metric is always 0.
* **`discreteModifiedMetric_L_one`** — Proves that when $L = 1$, the metric is always 0.

**How compilation was resolved.**
Since $d = 0$ or $L = 1$, the underlying type of cubes is a subsingleton (proven using `funext` and Lean's built-in `nomatch` construct for empty type elimination, or `Subsingleton.elim`). Thus, any spanning set $S$ has cardinality at most 1, so the Steiner tree length $S.card - 1$ is always 0.

**Honest scope.** This is purely combinatorial testing on degenerate lattice dimensions and sizes. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.


## Addendum 96 (2026-06-18, **holes-respected rooted activity sum bound**
`YangMills.RG.rootedHolePolymerSum` and `YangMills.RG.rootedHolePolymerSum_bound`; core 8265)

**Build:** green (rooted sum and bounds added to `HolePolymerSystem.lean`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum formalises the rooted polymer activity sum and its volume-independent upper bound:

* **`rootedHolePolymerSum`** — Defines the total activity sum of connected, hole-respecting polymers whose skeleton contains a fixed root $r$.
* **`rootedHolePolymerSum_bound`** — Proves a volume-uniform bound on the norm of the activity sum under the coordination entropy-suppression condition.

**How compilation was resolved.**
We bounded the norm of the activity sum by the sum of the norms using `norm_tsum_le_tsum_norm` (discharged via the finite-sum summability proof). We then mapped the sum over the subtype of polymers to a sum over all connected, hole-respecting finsets using `Fintype.sum_equiv` with a bijection `f1`, and majorized it via the discrete modified-metric summability theorem.

**Honest scope.** This provides the convergent activity sum bound required by the cluster expansion consumer. It does not prove the analytical Gaussian activity bounds for the renormalization group or the continuum limit. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.


## Addendum 97 (2026-06-18, **holes-respected polymer system KP convergence and bounds**
`YangMills.RG.holePolymerSystem_KPCriterion`, `YangMills.RG.holePolymerSystem_converges`, and `YangMills.RG.holePolymerSystem_norm_clusterSum_le`; core 8265)

**Build:** green (convergence theorems added to `HolePolymerSystem.lean`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum connects the holes-respected polymer system to the abstract Kotecký–Preiss convergence machinery, advancing **P3** (proving structural convergence under bare KP, while the analytical modified-metric decay bound on clusters remains open):

* **`holePolymerSystem_KPCriterion`** — Proves that under the modified-metric bound, a constant weight function $a(X) = 1$ satisfies the KP criterion for sufficiently small $q$.
* **`holePolymerSystem_converges`** — Proves that the Mayer cluster series for the holes-respected polymer system converges absolutely under the bare KP criterion.
* **`holePolymerSystem_norm_clusterSum_le`** — Establishes a quantitative bound on the norm of the cluster sum.

**How compilation was resolved.**
We verified that $q \leq 1$ holds since the polymer system has cardinality at least 1 (nonempty hypothesis), and used a `calc` block with `gcongr` to show that $q^{d_M + 1} \leq q$ for $0 \leq q \leq 1$ without external lemmas. We then instantiated `KP.kp_convergence_sharp` and `KP.kp_norm_clusterSum_le_sharp` directly.

**Honest scope.** This completes the combinatorial and structural convergence substrate of the cluster expansion with holes. It does not prove the analytical Gaussian activity bounds for the renormalization group or the continuum limit, nor does it establish the modified-metric decay bound on the cluster activities themselves. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.


## Addendum 98 (2026-06-18, **translation-invariance of the modified metric and polymer system**
`YangMills.RG.translatePolymer`, `YangMills.RG.holePolymerSystem_incomp_translate`, and `YangMills.RG.rootedHolePolymerSum_translate`; core 8265)

**Build:** green (translation theorems added to `Translation.lean`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum formalises the translation-invariance of the discrete modified metric, the holes-respected polymer system, and its rooted activity sum:

* **`translatePolymer`** — Defines the translation operator on polymers.
* **`holePolymerSystem_incomp_translate`** — Proves that translation preserves the incompatibility relation (overlap or touching) on the lattice.
* **`rootedHolePolymerSum_translate`** — Proves that the rooted polymer activity sum is translation-invariant on the torus under translated activity.

**How compilation was resolved.**
We constructed the bijection `g` between the root-centered polymer subtype and the translated root-centered subtype. We proved injectivity and surjectivity of `g` using the injection/surjection lemmas for polymer translation. Fintype sum equivalence was utilized to reduce the translated sum to the original sum, and `translateActivity_apply` resolved the activity identity.

**Honest scope.** This completes the translation-invariance substrate for the holes-respected polymer gas. It does not prove the analytical Gaussian activity bounds or the continuum limit. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 99 (2026-06-18, **volume-uniform Kotecky-Preiss criterion and convergence under local summability**
`YangMills.RG.closedNeigh`, `closedNeigh_card_le`, `incomp_imp_intersect`, `holePolymerSystem_KPCriterion_volumeUniform`, `holePolymerSystem_converges_volumeUniform`, and `holePolymerSystem_norm_clusterSum_le_volumeUniform`; core 8267)

**Build:** green (volume-uniform theorems added to `LocalKP.lean`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum formalises the volume-uniform Kotecký–Preiss criterion and absolute convergence of the holes-respected polymer system under a local volume-independent activity summability condition:

* **`closedNeigh`** — Defines the closed neighborhood of a set of cubes on the lattice.
* **`closedNeigh_card_le`** — Bounds the cardinality of the closed neighborhood of a set $X$ of cubes by $(3^d + 1) |X|$.
* **`incomp_imp_intersect`** — Proves that if two polymers $X, Y$ are incompatible, then $Y$ must intersect the closed neighborhood of $X$.
* **`holePolymerSystem_KPCriterion_volumeUniform`** — Establishes that the polymer system satisfies the KP criterion with weight function $a(X) = |X|$ under local volume-independent summability.
* **`holePolymerSystem_converges_volumeUniform`** — Proves the absolute convergence of the cluster series volume-uniformly.
* **`holePolymerSystem_norm_clusterSum_le_volumeUniform`** — Bounds the norm of the cluster sum volume-uniformly.

**How compilation was resolved.**
We bounded the cardinality of the closed neighborhood by first showing it is a subset of the big union of the single-element inserts and neighbor sets, and then majorized each neighbor set cardinality by $3^d$ (using the graph degree bound `cubeAdj_degree_le`). We established that incompatibility implies intersection with `closedNeigh` via a disjunction on overlap versus adjacency. The KP criterion was proved by bounding the sum over incompatible polymers by a big union over cubes in `closedNeigh X`, majorizing this by the local summability bound, and cancelling the $(3^d + 1)$ factors using `mul_inv_cancel₀` for `ℝ`.

**Honest scope.** This completes the volume-uniform convergence substrate of the cluster expansion for the holes-respected polymer gas under local summability. It does not prove the analytical Gaussian bounds on the activities. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 100 (2026-06-18, **cluster modified metric, decay weight base cases, and walk connectedness of unions**
`YangMills.RG.clusterUnion`, `clusterModifiedMetric`, `clusterUnion_skeleton`, `clusterUnion_fin_one`, `clusterModifiedMetric_fin_one`, `clusterDecayWeight`, `clusterDecayWeight_fin_one`, and `walkConnected_union`; core 8268)

**Build:** green (cluster definitions and theorems added to `ClusterDecay.lean`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum formalises the union and modified metric of polymer clusters, defines the cluster decay weight function under the modified metric, and establishes walk-connectedness for the union of two connected set-polymers that overlap or touch:

* **`clusterUnion`** — Defines the union of all polymers in a cluster.
* **`clusterModifiedMetric`** — Defines the modified metric of a cluster.
* **`clusterUnion_skeleton`** — Proves that the skeleton of a cluster union equals the big union of the individual polymer skeletons.
* **`clusterUnion_fin_one`** — Proves that for a single-polymer cluster ($n=1$), the cluster union reduces exactly to that polymer.
* **`clusterModifiedMetric_fin_one`** — Proves that for $n=1$, the cluster metric equals the individual polymer's modified metric.
* **`clusterDecayWeight`** — Defines the decay weight $q^{d_M(Union X) + 1}$ of a cluster.
* **`clusterDecayWeight_fin_one`** — Proves that for $n=1$, the cluster decay weight reduces to the single polymer's decay weight.
* **`walkConnected_union`** — Proves that the union of two connected sets that touch or overlap remains connected.

**How compilation was resolved.**
We defined `clusterUnion` as a big union over `Finset.univ` of the polymer values. We proved the skeleton union lemma `skeleton_biUnion` showing skeleton distributes over big unions, which resolved `clusterUnion_skeleton`. The single-polymer base case lemmas were proved using a subsingleton elimination on `Fin 1` to reduce the index of `Fin 1` to `0`. We proved `walkConnected_union` by performing a case analysis on the location of endpoints and constructing the concatenated path using `SimpleGraph.Walk.append` and `Walk.support_append` properties from Mathlib.

**Honest scope.** This completes the first mathematical targets of the polymer cluster remainder convergence substrate. It does not prove the analytical Gaussian activity bounds on clusters. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 101 (2026-06-19, **cluster remainder convergence substrate and metric monotonicity base case**
`YangMills.RG.walk_union_connected`, `YangMills.RG.cluster_closedNeigh_union_connected`, `YangMills.RG.clusterRemainderSum_summable`, and `YangMills.RG.discreteModifiedMetric_le_clusterModifiedMetric`; core 8268)

**Build:** green (the remaining Phase 8 targets added to `ClusterDecay.lean`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum formalises the Phase 8 substrate targets that were actually
proved:

* **`walk_union_connected`** — Proves that if we have a path in the incompatibility graph of a polymer cluster, we can connect the endpoints of the path in the big union of their closed neighborhoods.
* **`cluster_closedNeigh_union_connected`** — Proves that if `IsCluster` holds, then the union of the closed neighborhoods of all polymers in the cluster is connected.
* **`clusterRemainderSum_summable`** — Proves the absolute volume-uniform convergence of the cluster activity remainder sum under the local Kotecký–Preiss criterion.
* **`discreteModifiedMetric_le_clusterModifiedMetric`** — Establishes only the
  base case $n=1$, where the cluster union is exactly the single polymer.

**How compilation was resolved.**
We defined the connectivity of the union of closed neighborhoods using a path induction on the incompatibility graph. The remainder sum absolute convergence was bounded by introducing a parameter $t > 0$ and scaling the polymer activities, then applying the Kotecký–Preiss criterion to the scaled system to achieve a volume-uniform bound. The metric comparison was resolved only for the base case $n=1$ by using subsingleton elimination on the single polymer cluster index.

**Honest scope correction.** This does **not** prove an arbitrary-cluster
comparison `discreteModifiedMetric H (X i).val ≤ clusterModifiedMetric H z X`.
Subset inclusion of a polymer into the union is insufficient because
`discreteModifiedMetric` is a Steiner minimum constrained to lie inside its
ambient finset; enlarging the ambient set can introduce shortcuts.  The source
shape remains `d_M` of the cluster object/union, but downstream work must not
treat the `Fin 1` theorem as a general monotonicity lemma. Clay distance **~0%

## Addendum 102 (2026-06-19, **coarse gauge-renormalization operator Ū and its gauge covariance**
`YangMills.RG.UbarDeviation`, `coarseTransform`, `UbarDeviation_gaugeAct`, `rep_UbarDeviation_gaugeAct`, `Ubar`, and `Ubar_gaugeAct`; core 8269)

**Build:** green (the B4-Ū targets added to `Ubar.lean`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum formalises the coarse gauge-renormalization operator `Ū` on the lattice and proves its gauge covariance under a matrix representation of the gauge group:

* **`UbarDeviation`** — Defines the orientation-consistent path cancellation deviation term for a coarse edge $C$ at a fine site $x$.
* **`coarseTransform`** — Restricts a fine gauge transform to coarse lattice basepoints.
* **`UbarDeviation_gaugeAct`** — Proves that the deviation term conjugates by the source basepoint under gauge transformations.
* **`rep_UbarDeviation_gaugeAct`** — Transports the deviation gauge act theorem to the matrix algebra unit group representation.
* **`Ubar`** — Defines the coarse gauge-renormalization operator `Ū` using the matrix exponential, block average weights, and `nearLog`.
* **`Ubar_gaugeAct`** — Proves that `Ū` behaves like a coarse gauge configuration under gauge transformations (transforming by conjugation at the coarse edge endpoints).

**How compilation was resolved.**
We replaced implicit algebra coercions with explicit `.val` projections for `Units 𝔸` throughout the proof steps of `Ubar_gaugeAct` to avoid typeclass synthesis failures for `Inv 𝔸`. We resolved a stuck typeclass instance problem by supplying `(𝔸 := 𝔸)` explicitly to `rep_UbarDeviation_gaugeAct`. Finally, we proved the sum conjugation identity by constructing a sum-rewriting lemma `h_rw` and finished the main proof using precise right-associative rewriting (`← mul_assoc`, `Units.inv_mul`, `one_mul`).

**Honest scope.** This completes the target B4-Ū (full) from the gauge-RG campaign plan. It does not prove the analytical Gaussian activity bounds or the continuum limit. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.


## Addendum 103 (2026-06-19, **locality of the coarse gauge-renormalization operator Ū**
`YangMills.RG.wilsonLine_congr`, `YangMills.RG.UbarDeviation_congr`, and `YangMills.RG.Ubar_locality`; core 8269)

**Build:** green (locality theorems added to `Ubar.lean`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum formalises the locality of the coarse gauge-renormalization operator `Ū` on the lattice (Target B5-full):

* **`wilsonLine_congr`** — Proves that two gauge configurations that agree on all edges of a path produce the same Wilson line.
* **`UbarDeviation_congr`** — Proves that the deviation term `UbarDeviation` is local, depending only on the coarse edge value and the fine gauge configuration on the adjacent paths.
* **`Ubar_locality`** — Proves that `Ū` at a coarse edge $C$ depends only on the fine configuration on the paths within the blocks adjacent to the endpoints of $C$, and the coarse configuration at $C$.

**How compilation was resolved.**
We resolved a type mismatch in `wilsonLine_congr` by passing the prepended edge explicitly as `e` to `List.mem_cons_of_mem e he'` instead of omitting it. We resolved a let-binder definition mismatch in rewriting the sum inside `Ubar_locality` by defining the sum-equivalence lemma `h_sum` directly in terms of `blockOf L N' (FiniteLatticeGeometry.src C)` and applying `dsimp [Ubar]` prior to rewriting, which substituted local let bindings and allowed the rewrite to match exactly.

**Honest scope.** This completes the locality proof for the coarse averaging operator on the lattice. It does not prove the analytical Gaussian bounds on the activities or the continuum limit. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 104 (2026-06-19, **UV scale dictionary and concrete covUV target**
`YangMills.RG.scaleSpacing`, `YangMills.RG.covUV_concrete`, `YangMills.RG.covUV_polymer`, `YangMills.RG.covUV_polymer_eq`, `YangMills.RG.hUV_of_per_scale`, `YangMills.RG.lattice_mass_gap_of_cluster_and_coupling`, `YangMills.RG.lattice_mass_gap_of_cluster_and_logistic_coupling`, `YangMills.RG.lattice_mass_gap_uv_conditional_nonvacuous`, `YangMills.RG.lattice_mass_gap_of_per_scale_uv_summable`, and `YangMills.RG.lattice_mass_gap_of_cluster_and_marginal_coupling`; core 8269)

**Build:** green (the U0/U3 targets and mass gap refactoring added to `UVMassGap.lean` and `MarginalUVMassGap.lean`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum formalises the concrete representation of the ultraviolet covariance `covUV` and the scale-to-spacing dictionary, refactoring the mass gap conditionals to discharge the carried abstract covariance parameter:

* **`scaleSpacing`** — Defines the scale-to-spacing dictionary $a_k = a_* / L^{k_* - k}$.
* **`covUV_concrete`** — Defines the UV covariance as the concrete finite sum of scale remainders $\sum_{k < n(t)} R_{t,k}$.
* **`covUV_polymer`** — Defines the UV covariance in terms of underlying polymer activities.
* **`covUV_polymer_eq`** — Proves the equivalence of the polymer and remainder representation of the UV covariance.
* **`hUV_of_per_scale`** — Collapses the per-scale remainder geometric decay to the covariance-level UV decay.
* **Refactored mass gap theorems** — Refactors `lattice_mass_gap_of_cluster_and_coupling`, `lattice_mass_gap_of_cluster_and_logistic_coupling`, `lattice_mass_gap_uv_conditional_nonvacuous`, `lattice_mass_gap_of_per_scale_uv_summable`, and `lattice_mass_gap_of_cluster_and_marginal_coupling` to use `covUV_concrete` directly, eliminating the carried `covUV` parameter and `hcovUV` hypothesis.

**How compilation was resolved.**
We added the `noncomputable` keyword to `scaleSpacing`, `covUV_concrete`, and `covUV_polymer` to resolve Lean compiler errors regarding noncomputable division (`ℝ`) and `tsum`. We removed the unused `hc0` parameter from `hUV_of_per_scale` to clean up linter warnings, and eliminated `nsc` from the existential list in `lattice_mass_gap_uv_conditional_nonvacuous` to match the discharged `hcovUV` hypothesis. We added the missing `import YangMills.RG.UVMassGap` to `MarginalUVMassGap.lean` to make `covUV_concrete` visible.

**Honest scope.** This completes the UV scale dictionary and concrete target formulation (Target U0/U3). It does not prove the analytical Gaussian bounds on the activities or the continuum limit. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 105 (2026-06-19, **sharp second moment of the fundamental character**
`YangMills.ClayCore.signedSwapMat`, `YangMills.ClayCore.signedSwapSU`, `YangMills.ClayCore.instIsHaarMeasureSUN`, `YangMills.ClayCore.instIsMulRightInvariantSUN`, `YangMills.ClayCore.sunHaarProb_entry_normSq_eq`, `YangMills.ClayCore.sunHaarProb_entry_normSq_eq_inv_Nc`, and `YangMills.ClayCore.sunHaarProb_trace_normSq_integral_eq_one`; core 8270)

**Build:** green (the F1 target added to `SchurNormOne.lean`).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum formalises the sharp second moment of the fundamental character trace norm-squared:
\[ \int_{\text{SU}(N_c)} \|\text{tr } U\|^2 d\text{Haar} = 1 \]
for $N_c \ge 2$, closing the target F1 from the Schur-orthogonality program:

* **`signedSwapMat` & `signedSwapSU`** — Defines the signed swap matrix and shows it is a member of the special unitary group $\text{SU}(N)$.
* **Haar uniqueness on compact non-commutative groups** — Instantiates the compact Haar probability measure `sunHaarProb` and registers `IsHaarMeasure` and `IsMulRightInvariant` instances, bypassing the lack of generic Mathlib instances.
* **`sunHaarProb_entry_normSq_eq`** — Proves column-level entry norm-squared integral equality $\int |U_{mi}|^2 d\text{Haar} = \int |U_{mj}|^2 d\text{Haar}$ for any $i \neq j$ via right invariance under `signedSwapSU`.
* **`sunHaarProb_entry_normSq_eq_inv_Nc`** — Shows that each entry has integral $1/N_c$.
* **`sunHaarProb_trace_normSq_integral_eq_one`** — Proves the final Target F1 of the fundamental character trace norm-squared.

**How compilation was resolved.**
We solved compilation issues by ensuring all inequality symmetry relations (e.g., passing `hij.symm`, `Ne.symm hbi`, `Ne.symm hbj`, `Ne.symm hab`) were provided to `simp` to discharge sub-goals in matrix entry evaluations. We simplified the disjointness proof in `prod_decomp_two` to a direct contradiction, avoiding Let-binder and case-split variable renaming clashes. We removed duplicate and unused variables (`[NeZero N]` and `hN`) from the signatures of `sunHaarProb_entry_normSq_eq` and `sunHaarProb_trace_normSq_integral_eq_one` to address linter warnings.

**Honest scope.** This completes the sharp second moment of the fundamental character (Target F1). It does not prove the mass gap of the 4D Yang-Mills theory in the continuum limit. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 106 (2026-06-19, **exact Schur orthogonality for the fundamental SU(N) representation**

**Build:** green (`SchurFundamentalOrthogonality.lean` added to the verified core).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum closes the defining-representation case of the matrix-coefficient
Haar `L²` API:

* **`sunHaarProb_entry_offdiag_right`** — distinct columns are orthogonal, by
  right Haar invariance under a traceless diagonal phase. Together with the
  existing row-off-diagonal theorem, this covers every unequal coefficient.
* **`sunHaarProb_entry_normSq_integral_eq_inv_N`** — each fundamental matrix
  coefficient has squared Haar norm `1 / N`.
* **`sunHaarProb_fundamental_entry_orthogonality`** — the full four-index
  identity
  `∫ Uᵢⱼ conj(Uₖₗ) dHaar = if i = k ∧ j = l then 1 / N else 0`.
* **`fundamentalMatrixCoeffL2`** and
  **`inner_fundamentalMatrixCoeffL2`** — package the coefficients as vectors in
  Haar `L²` and restate the same identity as their Hilbert-space inner product.
* **`orthonormal_normalizedFundamentalMatrixCoeffL2`** — after multiplication
  by `√N`, the `Fin N × Fin N` coefficient family is an `Orthonormal ℂ` family
  in Haar `L²`, the interface consumed by the orthonormal half of Peter-Weyl.

**Honest scope.** This is Schur orthogonality for the defining representation
only. It does not prove generic compact-group Peter-Weyl, classify irreducible
SU(N) representations, construct the continuum limit, or prove the Clay mass
gap. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 107 (2026-06-19, **generic continuous-unitary matrix representation API**

**Build:** green (`ContinuousUnitaryRep.lean` added to the verified core).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum adds the reusable analytic half of the F2 representation API:

* **`ContinuousUnitaryMatrixRep G ι`** — a continuous monoid homomorphism from
  a topological group into Mathlib's `Matrix.unitaryGroup ι ℂ`.
* **`matrixCoeff` / `matrixCoeffL2`** — every coefficient is a continuous
  function and, on a compact domain with a finite Borel measure, has a
  canonical vector in `L²`.
* **`character` / `characterL2`** — the trace character has the same
  continuous and `L²` interfaces.
* **`character_conj`** — characters are invariant under group conjugation,
  proved using the unitary inclusion into matrix units and cyclicity of trace.
* **`fundamentalUnitaryRep`** — the defining representation of `SU(N)`
  instantiates the generic API, and its generic coefficients reduce
  definitionally to the entry functions used in Addendum 106.

**Honest scope.** This does not bundle basis-free representations, prove
irreducibility, compare inequivalent representations, or establish
Peter-Weyl density. It is infrastructure directly consumed by those future
statements. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 108 (2026-06-19, **continuous-unitary representations bridged to
Mathlib's algebraic Schur theory**; core 8272)

**Build:** green. Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

`ContinuousUnitaryMatrixRep.toRepresentation` turns the unitary matrix action
into Mathlib's algebraic `Representation ℂ G (ι → ℂ)`, with the action
computing definitionally as matrix-vector multiplication. This makes the
existing representation-theory library directly consumable:

* `intertwiner_bijective_or_eq_zero` states that an intertwiner between
  irreducible continuous unitary matrix representations is either bijective
  or zero.
* `exists_eq_smul_one_of_self_intertwiner` is the scalar form of Schur's
  lemma: every self-intertwiner of an irreducible finite-dimensional complex
  representation is a scalar multiple of the identity.

These are algebraic Schur conclusions, not generic Haar orthogonality. No
irreducibility classification, inter-representation integral formula, or
Peter-Weyl density theorem is claimed. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%),
unchanged**.


## Addendum 110 (2026-06-19, **Extra High audit correction of the lattice `Ū` logarithm**
`YangMills.RG.UbarDeviationLogArg`, `YangMills.RG.UbarDeviationLogArg_gaugeAct`,
repaired `YangMills.RG.Ubar` / `YangMills.RG.Ubar_gaugeAct` /
`YangMills.RG.Ubar_locality`, `YangMills.RG.clusterUnion_connected`, and the
current `YangMills.ClayCore.GenericSchurOrthogonality` scalar self-average)

**Build:** green (`lake build YangMillsCore`, 8273 jobs).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

The Extra High audit found a semantic error in Addenda 102–103: `nearLog Y` is the
Mercator series for `log(1 + Y)`, but the lattice `Ū` definition fed it the represented
deviation group element `D` itself.  CMP 109 (0.12) applies `log` to the near-identity
deviation group element
`U(c₋,x)·U(x,x(c))⁻¹·U(x(c),c₊)·U(-c)`.  Therefore the Lean Mercator argument must be
`D - 1`.

Repair:

* `UbarDeviationLogArg` now packages the faithful logarithm variable
  `(MatrixRealization.rep (UbarDeviation ...)).val - 1`.
* `Ubar` averages `nearLog (UbarDeviationLogArg ...)`; the covariance hypothesis is now
  `‖UbarDeviationLogArg ...‖ < 1`, not `‖rep(D).val‖ < 1`.
* `units_conj_sub_one` and `UbarDeviationLogArg_gaugeAct` prove the required subtraction
  covariance
  `u·D·u⁻¹ - 1 = u·(D - 1)·u⁻¹`, so `nearLog_conj` applies to the faithful variable.
* `represented_group_element_norm_lt_one_impossible_of_norm_eq_one` records the physical
  calibration: in a unitary realization where `‖D‖ = 1`, the old strict premise
  `‖D‖ < 1` is impossible.
* `UbarDeviationLogArg_small_of_deviation_eq_one` records non-vacuity of the corrected
  small-field premise at exact identity deviation.

The audit also checked the latest
`sunHaarProb_trace_normSq_integral_eq_one` and the concrete/marginal UV assembly for
scope overclaim: the Haar theorem is an exact SU(N) Haar character-norm statement, while
the UV mass-gap assembly continues to carry the analytic RG activity and IR inputs as
explicit hypotheses.  No repair was needed there.

The second Extra High escalation, `clusterModifiedMetric`, was also audited against the
Dimock source notes.  The definition as `discreteModifiedMetric` of the cluster union is
the source-shaped `d_M(Y, mod Ωᶜ)` for the cluster object.  However, the requested
arbitrary constituent comparison is not a formal monotonicity fact and should not be
claimed: the metric is a constrained Steiner minimum, so enlarging the ambient finset can
add shortcuts.  The code already proved only the valid `Fin 1` comparison; this audit
repairs the documentation and the Phase 8 ledger wording so downstream work cannot treat
that base case as a general theorem.

As the next source-grounded RG-activity substrate step, the audit adds
`clusterUnion_connected`: a genuine hole-polymer cluster has connected raw union because
the incompatibility graph chains constituent polymers by overlap or one-step cube
adjacency.  This supports the `d_M`-of-union design without asserting the false
constituent-metric monotonicity.

During full-core verification, the tracked `GenericSchurOrthogonality.lean` changes failed
on a fragile probability-Haar constant-integral rewrite and on the final diagonal
coefficient simplification.  This checkpoint repairs those proofs and verifies
`trace_haarAverageMatrix`, `haarAverageMatrix_eq_trace_div_card_smul_one`, and
`integral_matrixCoeff_mul_star`: for an irreducible finite-dimensional continuous unitary
representation, the self matrix-coefficient integral is
`δᵢₖ δⱼₗ / Fintype.card ι`.  This closes the scalar half that the previous generic-Haar
entry had left open; Peter-Weyl density remains open.

**Honest scope.** This fixes a real source-faithfulness bug in the `Ū` layer and prevents
downstream work from relying on the physically impossible old `‖D‖ < 1` premise.  It does
not prove the Balaban/Dimock activity estimate, the continuum limit, or OS/Wightman
reconstruction. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 111 (2026-06-19, **cluster-level modified-metric skeleton control**
`YangMills.RG.clusterUnion_skeleton_card_le_clusterModifiedMetric_add_one`; core 8273)

**Build:** green (`lake build YangMillsCore`, 8273 jobs).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum closes the immediate post-audit cluster-metric interface.  The
Extra High audit rejected the tempting but false arbitrary comparison
`discreteModifiedMetric H (X i).val ≤ clusterModifiedMetric H z X`: the modified
metric is a constrained Steiner minimum, so enlarging the ambient set can create
shortcuts and is not monotone in that direction.  The source-faithful object is
instead the whole cluster union.

The new theorem states exactly that valid cluster-level fact:
`clusterUnion_skeleton_card_le_clusterModifiedMetric_add_one` proves that if
`X` is a genuine `IsCluster` tuple in the hole-polymer system, then

`(skeleton H (clusterUnion H z X)).card ≤ clusterModifiedMetric H z X + 1`.

The proof is intentionally short: `clusterUnion_connected` supplies connectedness
of the raw cluster union, and the already-proved
`skeleton_card_le_discreteModifiedMetric_add_one` applies to that union.  This
is the interface the later activity-decay proof can consume: metric decay of the
cluster object controls the size of its active skeleton, without asserting any
unsupported constituent-polymer monotonicity.

**Honest scope.** This is an RG-substrate theorem toward the Balaban/Dimock
`hRpoly` activity estimate.  It does not prove the activity decay, the continuum
limit, or OS/Wightman reconstruction. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 112 (2026-06-19, **cluster unions packaged as hole polymers**
`YangMills.RG.polymerWithHoles_biUnion`, `YangMills.RG.clusterUnion_polymerWithHoles`,
`YangMills.RG.clusterUnion_nonempty`, `YangMills.RG.clusterUnionPolymer`; core 8273)

**Build:** green (`lake build YangMillsCore`, 8273 jobs).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum packages the source-shaped cluster object as an actual polymer of
the holes-respected polymer system whenever the cluster tuple is nonempty.

* `polymerWithHoles_biUnion` proves that a finite union of hole-respecting sets
  is hole-respecting: if a hole is contained in one summand, it is contained in
  the union; otherwise it is disjoint from every summand and hence from the
  union.
* `clusterUnion_polymerWithHoles` specializes that statement to the raw union of
  a tuple of hole polymers.
* `clusterUnion_nonempty` records that a `Fin (n+1)` tuple of nonempty polymers
  has nonempty raw union.
* `clusterUnionPolymer` combines nonemptiness, `clusterUnion_connected`, and
  `clusterUnion_polymerWithHoles` into a single subtype package:
  the raw union of a nonempty genuine cluster is itself a valid
  `(holePolymerSystem H z).Polymer`.

Together with Addendum 111, this gives downstream `hRpoly` work a clean object:
the cluster can be collapsed to its union polymer, and the modified metric of
that union controls its active skeleton.  No unsupported constituent-polymer
metric monotonicity is used.

**Honest scope.** This is still RG substrate for the Balaban/Dimock activity
estimate.  It does not prove the activity decay, continuum limit, or
OS/Wightman reconstruction. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 113 (2026-06-19, **skeleton-pinned cluster remainder summability**
`YangMills.RG.clusterSkeletonRemainderSumTerm`,
`YangMills.RG.clusterSkeletonRemainderSumTerm_le`,
`YangMills.RG.clusterSkeletonRemainderSum_summable`; core 8273)

**Build:** green (`lake build YangMillsCore`, 8273 jobs).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum adds the source-shaped cluster remainder variant pinned at the
active skeleton of the cluster union, rather than merely at any point of the raw
cluster union.

* `clusterSkeletonRemainderSumTerm` is the skeleton-pinned analogue of
  `clusterRemainderSumTerm`: the filter is
  `IsCluster P X ∧ r ∈ skeleton H (clusterUnion H z X)`.
* `clusterSkeletonRemainderSumTerm_le` proves termwise domination by the
  existing raw-union-pinned term.  The proof uses only the defining inclusion
  `skeleton_subset H (clusterUnion H z X)` and nonnegativity of the Ursell/activity
  norm factor.
* `clusterSkeletonRemainderSum_summable` transfers the existing summability
  theorem to the skeleton-pinned series by `Summable.of_nonneg_of_le`.

This is the correct support shape for the later activity-decay theorem: Dimock's
modified metric weights the active skeleton of the cluster object.  No new
activity estimate, paper constant, or constituent-polymer metric monotonicity is
claimed.

**Honest scope.** This is RG summability substrate toward `hRpoly`; the
Balaban/Dimock activity-decay estimate itself remains open.  It does not prove
the continuum limit or OS/Wightman reconstruction. Clay distance **~0%
(<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 114 (2026-06-19, **skeleton-pinned terms bounded by pinned cluster weights**
`YangMills.RG.clusterSkeletonRemainderSum_term_le_pinned`; core 8273)

**Build:** green (`lake build YangMillsCore`, 8273 jobs).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum exposes the termwise bound that Addendum 113 implicitly uses:

`clusterSkeletonRemainderSumTerm H z r n ≤ (n+1) · Σ_{c∋r} pinnedClusterWeight (holePolymerSystem H z) c n`.

The proof is a clean two-lemma chain: skeleton-pinned terms are dominated by
raw-union-pinned terms (`clusterSkeletonRemainderSumTerm_le`), and raw-union
terms are bounded by the already-proved pinned-cluster-weight estimate
(`clusterRemainderSum_term_le`).  This gives future `hRpoly` work a single named
inequality from the source-shaped skeleton support condition to the banked KP
pinned-weight machinery.

**Honest scope.** This is still summability/weight substrate only.  The
Balaban/Dimock activity-decay estimate remains open; no continuum limit or
OS/Wightman reconstruction is claimed. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 115 (2026-06-19, **skeleton-pinned cluster remainder sum bound**
`YangMills.RG.clusterSkeletonRemainderSum_term_le_skeletonPinned`,

`YangMills.RG.clusterSkeletonRemainderSum_tsum_le`; core 8273)

**Build:** green (`lake build YangMillsCore`, 8273 jobs).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum turns the termwise skeleton-pinned bridge into the quantitative
total-series estimate consumed by the next `hRpoly` interface:

* `clusterSkeletonRemainderSum_term_le_skeletonPinned` sharpens the root
  symmetrization: from `r ∈ skeleton H (clusterUnion H z X)`, it pins at a
  constituent polymer whose own active skeleton contains `r`.
* `clusterSkeletonRemainderSum_term_le_tilt` pays the order factor `(n+1)` by
  the standard `scaleActivity (exp t)` tilt, producing a bound by the tilted
  pinned-cluster weights under an explicit `0 < t`.
* `clusterSkeletonRemainderSum_tsum_le` sums over all orders and applies
  `pinned_cluster_summable_sharp` under the explicit tilted KP criterion,
  bounding the skeleton-pinned remainder series by
  `t⁻¹ * Σ_{r∈skeleton(c)} exp(t) * ‖activity c‖ * exp(|c|)`.

This is the source-shaped skeleton analogue of the KP restriction/off-region
tail estimate: the final pinned sum is still keyed by active-skeleton
membership, not merely raw support membership.

**Honest scope.** The theorem still assumes the tilted KP criterion and does
not prove the concrete Yang-Mills activity decay.  The remaining hard input is
the Balaban/Dimock fluctuation-integral estimate for the actual gauge RG
operator.  No continuum limit or OS/Wightman reconstruction is claimed. Clay
distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 116 (2026-06-19, **metric activity decay consumed by skeleton remainders**
`YangMills.RG.clusterSkeletonRemainderSum_tsum_le_metric_bound`; core 8273)

**Build:** green (`lake build YangMillsCore`, 8273 jobs).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum closes the next connector after Addendum 115.  The theorem
`clusterSkeletonRemainderSum_tsum_le_metric_bound` proves:

if the tilted, cardinality-weighted hole-polymer activity satisfies the
Dimock-shaped bound

`exp(t) * ‖activity(c)‖ * exp(|c|) ≤ A * q^(discreteModifiedMetric(c)+1)`,

then the total skeleton-pinned cluster remainder is bounded by

`t⁻¹ * A * (1 - (3^d)^2 * (q * 2^(3^d+1)))⁻¹`,

under the already-formalized hole-disjointness / no-cross-edge / nonempty-hole
conditions and the smallness condition on `q`.

The proof composes the skeleton-rooted pinned cluster estimate
(`clusterSkeletonRemainderSum_tsum_le`) with the discrete modified-metric
summability theorem (`discreteModifiedMetric_weight_summable`).  The only
bookkeeping is the subtype/equivalence bridge from
`{c : PolymerType H z // r ∈ skeleton H c.val}` to raw connected
hole-respecting finsets.

**Honest scope.** This proves the exact consumer side of the Balaban-Dimock
activity-decay input.  It still does not prove that activity estimate for the
actual Yang-Mills RG operator; that remains the `hRpoly`/P3-P4 analytic core.
No continuum limit or OS/Wightman reconstruction is claimed. Clay distance
**~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 117 (2026-06-19, **tilted local KP criterion and one-shot skeleton metric bound**
`YangMills.RG.holePolymerSystem_KPCriterion_volumeUniform_scaled`,
`YangMills.RG.clusterSkeletonRemainderSum_tsum_le_metric_bound_of_local`;
core 8273)

**Build:** green (`lake build YangMillsCore`, 8273 jobs).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum removes a technical carried hypothesis from Addendum 116's
consumer theorem.  The new theorem
`holePolymerSystem_KPCriterion_volumeUniform_scaled` proves the
volume-uniform Kotecký-Preiss criterion for the scalar-tilted hole polymer
system directly from the local tilted activity-sum smallness condition:

`Σ_{Y∋s} ‖ρ · z(Y)‖ · exp(|Y|) ≤ (3^d+1)⁻¹`.

The proof is the same local-neighbourhood argument as the unscaled
`holePolymerSystem_KPCriterion_volumeUniform`: incompatibilities are covered by
the closed neighbourhood, whose cardinality is bounded by `(3^d+1)|X|`.

The follow-up theorem
`clusterSkeletonRemainderSum_tsum_le_metric_bound_of_local` then combines:

* the scaled local KP criterion at `ρ = exp(t)`;
* the skeleton-rooted cluster remainder estimate;
* the modified-metric activity-decay hypothesis;
* the discrete modified-metric summability theorem.

It yields the same volume-uniform skeleton remainder bound as Addendum 116 but
with the KP criterion derived internally from the local summability window.

**Honest scope.** The theorem still assumes the local activity-sum smallness
and the modified-metric activity-decay estimate.  Those are exactly the
Balaban/Dimock `hRpoly`/P3-P4 analytic inputs; they are not proved here.  No
continuum limit or OS/Wightman reconstruction is claimed. Clay distance **~0%
(<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 118 (2026-06-19, **scaled local KP convergence API**

**Build:** green (`lake build YangMillsCore`, 8273 jobs).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum rounds off the API opened in Addendum 117.  The scaled local KP
criterion now feeds the same two sharp KP interfaces already available in the
unscaled local theory:

* `holePolymerSystem_converges_volumeUniform_scaled` — absolute convergence of
  the scalar-tilted hole-polymer cluster series;
* `holePolymerSystem_norm_clusterSum_le_volumeUniform_scaled` — the matching
  volume-uniform norm bound for the tilted cluster sum.

Both theorems are direct applications of `KP.kp_convergence_sharp` and
`KP.kp_norm_clusterSum_le_sharp` to the scalar-tilted polymer system, with
`holePolymerSystem_KPCriterion_volumeUniform_scaled` supplying the criterion.

**Honest scope.** These are consumer/API theorems for a scalar activity tilt.
They do not prove the Yang-Mills activity-decay estimate, the cluster expansion
with holes, the continuum limit, or OS/Wightman reconstruction. Clay distance
**~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 119 (2026-06-19, **local skeleton-tail interfaces**

**Build:** green (`lake build YangMillsCore`, 8273 jobs).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum removes the explicit tilted KP hypothesis from the two lower
skeleton-tail interfaces:

* `clusterSkeletonRemainderSum_summable_of_local` proves summability of the
  skeleton-pinned cluster remainder series from the local tilted
  activity-sum window;
* `clusterSkeletonRemainderSum_tsum_le_of_local` proves the pre-metric
  quantitative skeleton-pinned bound from the same local window.

Both theorems derive the scalar-tilted KP criterion through
`holePolymerSystem_KPCriterion_volumeUniform_scaled`, exactly as the later
metric-bound theorem does.  The skeleton-tail ladder is now uniformly
source-shaped: local tilted smallness feeds summability, the pinned KP bound,
and the modified-metric consumer theorem without carrying a separate
`KPCriterion` hypothesis at each layer.

**Honest scope.** These are still consumer theorems.  They do not bridge
raw-support local smallness from skeleton-rooted modified-metric summability,
and they do not prove the Balaban/Dimock Yang-Mills activity-decay estimate.
Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

**Build:** green (`lake build YangMillsCore`, 8273 jobs).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum names the exact `ρ = exp(t)` specialization repeatedly consumed
by the RG tail estimates.  The local smallness window is source-shaped as

`Σ_{Y∋s} exp(t) * ‖z(Y)‖ * exp(|Y|) ≤ (3^d+1)⁻¹`,

while the polymer system is the scalar-tilted system
`(holePolymerSystem H z).scaleActivity (Real.exp t)`.  The bridge theorem
`holePolymerSystem_KPCriterion_volumeUniform_exp` converts between these two
presentations once, using positivity of `exp(t)`.  The companion convergence
and norm-bound theorems expose the same specialization at the cluster-series
API level.

The skeleton-tail `_of_local` theorems now call this named bridge instead of
rebuilding the scalar-norm conversion internally.

**Honest scope.** This is an API consolidation for the already-carried local
activity window.  It does not prove local smallness, the Yang-Mills
activity-decay estimate, or any continuum/OS result. Clay distance **~0%
(<0.1%), unchanged**.

**Build:** green (`lake build YangMillsCore`, 8273 jobs).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum adds the raw-union-pinned companion to the skeleton local-tail
interfaces.  `clusterRemainderSum_summable_of_local` proves summability of the
raw cluster remainder series from the source-shaped tilted local window

`Σ_{Y∋s} exp(t) * ‖z(Y)‖ * exp(|Y|) ≤ (3^d+1)⁻¹`,

deriving the scalar-tilted KP criterion through
`holePolymerSystem_KPCriterion_volumeUniform_exp` rather than carrying an
abstract `KPCriterion` hypothesis.  This keeps the lower tail layer aligned
with the later skeleton-pinned `_of_local` API.

**Honest scope.** This is still a consumer theorem for an explicit local
smallness hypothesis.  It does not prove that local smallness from the
modified-metric activity decay, nor the Balaban/Dimock cluster expansion with
holes. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

This addendum completes the raw-union-pinned lower tail API.  The theorem
`clusterRemainderSum_tsum_le` bounds the full raw-pinned cluster remainder

factor:

`Σ'_n R_raw(r,n) ≤ t⁻¹ Σ_{c∋r} exp(t) * ‖z(c)‖ * exp(|c|)`.

The wrapper `clusterRemainderSum_tsum_le_of_local` derives the required
tilted KP criterion from the source-shaped local smallness window via
`holePolymerSystem_KPCriterion_volumeUniform_exp`.  Together with Addendum
121, the raw tail layer now has both summability and a quantitative local
consumer theorem, matching the shape already available for the skeleton layer.

**Honest scope.** This theorem consumes raw-support local smallness; it does
not derive that smallness from skeleton-rooted modified-metric estimates.  The
Balaban/Dimock activity-decay theorem and the cluster expansion with holes
remain the open analytic inputs. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

**Build:** green (`lake build YangMillsCore`, 8273 jobs).
Oracle: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

This addendum extracts the order-factor tilt algebra as a reusable pinned
cluster-weight lemma.  `orderFactor_pinnedClusterWeight_le_tilt` proves at the
KP layer that `(n+1) * pinnedClusterWeight P c n` is dominated by the
`exp(t)`-tilted pinned weight with a global `t⁻¹` loss, using
`t(n+1) ≤ exp(t(n+1))` and `pinnedClusterWeight_scale`.
`clusterRemainderSum_term_le_tilt` is now the raw-tail specialization, and
the skeleton termwise tilt theorem also consumes the same KP lemma.

not add a new physical estimate and does not bridge the unresolved
raw-support/skeleton-rooted local-smallness issue. Clay distance **~0%

This addendum names the scalar-norm and finite-pin `tsum` bookkeeping
repeatedly used by off-region and RG cluster-tail estimates.
`scaleActivity_exp_norm_activity_mul_exp` identifies the weighted norm of the
`exp(t)`-tilted activity with `exp(t) * ‖z(c)‖ * exp(a(c))`.  Under a sharp KP criterion,
`summable_finset_pinnedClusterWeight` proves summability of
`n ↦ Σ_{c∈s} pinnedClusterWeight P c n`, and
`tsum_finset_pinnedClusterWeight_le` proves

`Σ'_n Σ_{c∈s} pinnedClusterWeight P c n ≤ Σ_{c∈s} ‖z(c)‖ e^{a(c)}`.

The proof is the finite exchange `Summable.tsum_finsetSum` followed by the
per-polymer sharp pinned theorem.  The existing off-region, raw-tail, and
skeleton-tail bounds now consume this KP-level helper instead of rebuilding
the exchange locally.

**Honest scope.** This is proof factoring inside the verified KP/RG
summability substrate.  It does not strengthen the physical hypotheses and
does not address the open Balaban/Dimock activity-decay or
raw-support/skeleton-rooted local-smallness bridge. Clay distance **~0%

This addendum packages the character-level corollaries of the generic
matrix-coefficient Schur orthogonality API.

* `integral_character_mul_star_eq_zero_of_not_equiv` proves that characters of
  inequivalent irreducible continuous unitary matrix representations are
  orthogonal in Haar `L²`.
* `integral_character_mul_star` proves that an irreducible character has Haar
  `L²` norm one.

Both proofs expand characters as finite traces, exchange the finite sums with
the integral, and consume the already-verified coefficient identities
`integral_matrixCoeff_mul_star_eq_zero_of_not_equiv` and
`integral_matrixCoeff_mul_star`.

**Honest scope.** This is the character-level Schur orthogonality corollary for

This addendum packages the generic irreducible character orthogonality from
Addendum 125 in Mathlib's Hilbert-space `L²` interface.  The theorem
`inner_characterL2_eq_zero_of_not_equiv` says that the `characterL2` vectors of
inequivalent irreducible continuous unitary matrix representations are
orthogonal, and `inner_characterL2` says that an irreducible character has unit
inner product with itself.  Both wrappers are direct applications of
`ContinuousMap.inner_toLp` followed by the integral character identities.
The theorem `orthonormal_characterL2` then packages any finite family of
pairwise inequivalent irreducible characters as an `Orthonormal` family.

**Honest scope.** This is API packaging for the F2/Peter-Weyl substrate.  It
does not add Peter-Weyl completeness, SU(N) representation classification,
continuum construction, or the open `hRpoly` activity-decay estimate. Clay

This addendum adds the source-facing consumer for the current `hRpoly`
frontier.  If a source proves the pointwise activity decay

`exp(t) * ‖z(c)‖ * exp(|c|) ≤ A * q^(d_M(c)+1)`

and also proves the **raw-support** local smallness of that same majorant,

`Σ_{Y∋s} A * q^(d_M(Y)+1) ≤ (3^d+1)^(-1)`,

then
`clusterSkeletonRemainderSum_tsum_le_metric_bound_of_raw_local_metric`
derives the local KP window and applies the existing skeleton metric
consumer, yielding the usual
`t^(-1) * A * (1 - (3^d)^2 * (q * 2^(3^d+1)))^(-1)` bound.

**Honest scope.** This deliberately does **not** derive raw-support local
smallness from skeleton-rooted modified-metric summability.  That bridge
remains blocked pending a Yang-Mills source giving raw-support activity
control, hole-interior suppression, or a polymer-class restriction.  The
theorem is a verified consumer for such a source input, not a proof of the
Yang-Mills activity estimate. Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

This addendum extracts the classical finite-family consequence of Addendum 126:
pairwise inequivalent irreducible continuous unitary matrix characters are
linearly independent in Haar `L²`.  The proof uses the Hilbert-space route:
`orthonormal_characterL2` followed by Mathlib's
`Orthonormal.linearIndependent`.

**Honest scope.** This is still finite-family F2/Peter-Weyl substrate.  It does

This addendum adds the finite Fourier-coefficient identity for the generic
character substrate.  For a finite pairwise-inequivalent family of irreducible
continuous unitary matrix representations, the coefficient `c a` in
`Σ b, c b • characterL2(ρ b)` is recovered as the Haar `L²` inner product with
`characterL2(ρ a)`.  The proof is the existing finite orthonormal family theorem
followed by Mathlib's `Orthonormal.inner_right_sum`.

This addendum packages the consumer form of the coefficient-extraction theorem:
inside a fixed finite pairwise-inequivalent family of irreducible continuous
unitary matrix representations, two finite Haar-`L²` character expansions are
equal if and only if their coefficient functions are equal.  The proof applies
`inner_characterL2_sum` to both sides after taking inner product with each
basis character.

**Honest scope.** This is finite-dimensional/finite-family uniqueness only.

This addendum records the zero-expansion consumer of Addendum 130: in a fixed
finite pairwise-inequivalent family of irreducible continuous unitary matrix
characters, a finite Haar-`L²` character expansion is zero if and only if every
coefficient is zero.  The proof is the uniqueness theorem specialized to the
zero coefficient function.

**Honest scope.** This is still only a finite-family Hilbert-space fact.  It

`⟪Σ a, c a • χ_a, Σ a, d a • χ_a⟫ = Σ a, star (c a) * d a`.

The proof is Mathlib's `Orthonormal.inner_sum` applied to

The proof combines the finite Gram formula with
`InnerProductSpace.norm_sq_eq_re_inner` and the elementary complex identity
`star z * z = ‖z‖²`.

**Honest scope.** This is a finite Parseval identity for a fixed finite

This addendum adds the finite-distance consumer of the Parseval formula.  For
two coefficient functions `c,d` on a fixed finite pairwise-inequivalent
irreducible character family, the Haar-`L²` squared norm of the difference of
the two finite character expansions is exactly

`Σ a, ‖c a - d a‖²`.

The proof rewrites the difference of the two sums as the expansion with
coefficients `c-d`, then applies `norm_sq_characterL2_sum`.

This addendum records a source-audit correction and the corresponding Lean
interface.  Direct extraction of Dimock II Appendix F (arXiv:1212.5562,
PDF pp. 91–92) shows that the with-holes cluster expansion uses
`Ω`-connectedness: two polymers are connected for the cluster relation when
`X₁ ∩ Ω` and `X₂ ∩ Ω` have nonempty intersection, equivalently
`X₁ ∩ X₂ ∩ Ω ≠ ∅`; `Ω`-disjoint need not be disjoint.  This is not the same
relation as the existing touching hard-core `holePolymerSystem`, whose
incompatibility is ordinary full-polymer overlap or one-step cube adjacency.

The new `omegaHolePolymerSystem` keeps the same connected,
hole-respecting finite cube sets, restricts to nonempty active skeletons, and
sets incompatibility to `¬ Disjoint (skeleton H X) (skeleton H Y)`.  The
elementwise theorem
`omegaHolePolymerSystem_incomp_iff_exists` packages the Appendix-F form:
incompatibility iff there exists an active cube contained in both skeletons.

**Honest scope.** This does not prove the cluster expansion with holes, the
Yang-Mills activity-decay estimate, or any continuum theorem.  It prevents a
semantic overclaim: future P3 work must either use the source-facing
`omegaHolePolymerSystem` or prove a comparison theorem before reusing the

This addendum records the source-facing local KP package for the active
Appendix-F relation.  The key inclusion
`omega_filter_incomp_subset_skeleton` proves that every polymer incompatible
with `X` in `omegaHolePolymerSystem` is covered by a root in the active
skeleton of `X`.  Therefore a local window

`Σ_{Y : s ∈ skeleton(Y)} exp(t) · ‖z(Y)‖ · exp(|Y|) ≤ 1`

at every active cube `s` implies the Kotecký-Preiss criterion for
`(omegaHolePolymerSystem H z).scaleActivity (exp t)` with weight `|X|`.
The same package includes unscaled/scaled criteria and the corresponding
Mayer-series convergence and cluster-sum norm bounds.

**Honest scope.** This is the KP consumer for Dimock's literal
`Ω`-connected cluster relation, not the Yang-Mills single-scale activity
decay itself.  The hard analytic bound still has to supply the local active

If every active polymer satisfies the Dimock-shaped pointwise majorant

`exp(t) · ‖z(Y)‖ · exp(|Y|) ≤ A · q^(d_M(Y)+1)`

and the P2b discrete modified-metric summability constant obeys
`A · (1 - (3^d)^2 · (q · 2^(3^d+1)))⁻¹ ≤ 1`, then
`omegaHolePolymerSystem` satisfies the exponential-tilted KP criterion with
weight `|X|`.  The proof reindexes the active-skeleton local sum into the
already-proved modified-metric summability theorem; no Appendix-F activity
decay is assumed hiddenly beyond the explicit pointwise majorant.

**Honest scope.** This closes the consumer path

This addendum packages Addendum 137 through the standard KP consumers.  Under
the same explicit pointwise modified-metric activity majorant and smallness
hypotheses, the exponential-tilted source-facing `Ω`-active Mayer series is
summable, and its cluster-sum norm is bounded by the usual KP activity norm
sum.  This gives the future activity-decay theorem a direct consumer theorem
instead of requiring it to separately invoke the KP criterion.

This addendum extends the source-facing `Ω`-active Appendix-F path from the
global KP criterion/cluster-sum consumer to the skeleton-pinned cluster-tail
consumer used by the RG remainder estimates.  The new term
`omegaClusterSkeletonRemainderSumTerm` sums genuine clusters of
`omegaHolePolymerSystem`, pinned when the root lies in the active skeleton of
the raw cluster union.  The symmetrization lemma
`omegaClusterSkeletonRemainderSum_term_le_skeletonPinned` shows that such a
cluster can be pinned at one constituent polymer whose own active skeleton
contains the root; the `exp(t)` tilt then pays the cluster order exactly as in
the older touching-system proof.  Consequently
`omegaClusterSkeletonRemainderSum_tsum_le_metric_bound` proves the active
cluster-tail estimate

`Σₙ omegaClusterSkeletonRemainderSumTerm ≤
 t⁻¹ · A · (1 - (3^d)^2 · (q · 2^(3^d+1)))⁻¹`

under the same pointwise modified-metric majorant
`exp(t) · ‖z(Y)‖ · exp(|Y|) ≤ A · q^(d_M(Y)+1)` and smallness hypotheses
used by Addenda 137–138.

**Honest scope.** This closes another consumer-side mismatch: future P3/P4
work can feed the literal `Ω`-connected Appendix-F relation all the way to a
skeleton-pinned remainder tail, without detouring through the older touching
hard-core system.  It still does not prove the Yang-Mills activity-decay

This addendum adds the intermediate source-facing forms for the literal
`Ω`-active Appendix-F relation.  Addendum 139 consumed either a tilted KP
criterion directly or a pointwise modified-metric majorant.  The new theorems
consume the local active-skeleton window

`Σ_{Y : s ∈ skeleton(Y)} exp(t) · ‖z(Y)‖ · exp(|Y|) ≤ 1`

and derive, respectively, summability of the skeleton-pinned active cluster
tail and the quantitative bound by the root-pinned local activity mass.

**Why this matters.**  The Balaban/Yang-Mills source may present the remaining
activity control as a polymer norm or local KP window rather than as a literal
pointwise `A · q^(d_M+1)` estimate.  These theorems let future P3/P4 work feed
that local-window form directly, without inventing an unnecessary metric
majorant or detouring through the older touching hard-core system.

This addendum packages Addendum 140's local-window consumer in the form most

`Σ_{Y : s ∈ skeleton(Y)} exp(t) · ‖z(Y)‖ · exp(|Y|) ≤ B ≤ 1`.

The new summability theorem derives the same skeleton-pinned active cluster
tail convergence, and the quantitative theorem gives the compact bound

**Honest scope.** This is a downstream consumer of a local polymer norm bound,

This addendum records the first Lean brick extracted from the collar
factorization idea suggested by Lluis Eriksson's `ai.vixra:2512.0064v1`
outlook and the follow-up audit notes.  The thermodynamic maintenance-power
interpretation is deliberately **not** imported into `YangMillsCore`; the useful
mathematical content is the static covariance-decay step.

The theorem states that if an exponentially-decaying kernel satisfies
`|K i j| ≤ a exp(-κ d(i,j))`, and finite regions `A` and `B` are separated by a
collar `ε`, then for nonnegative derivative weights `L_i`, `M_j`,

`Σ_{i∈A,j∈B} |K i j| L_i M_j ≤
 a exp(-κ ε) (Σ_{i∈A} L_i)(Σ_{j∈B} M_j)`.

This is the deterministic finite-sum core that a future Gaussian interpolation
or integration-by-parts factorization theorem will consume.  It turns covariance
`ExpDecay` plus collar separation into the exact exponential price paid by a
cross-region influence term.

**Honest scope.** This is a source-independent algebraic substrate theorem.  It

This addendum records the green part of the block-1 paper audit around large
fields and near-identity charts.  The source-facing claim is the local
dictionary between a near-identity group deviation and its logarithmic
coordinate: Bałaban's analytic logarithm is applied to the deviation from the
identity, so the Lean variable is `Y = D - 1`, not the represented group
element `D` itself.

The raw comparison theorem is

`‖Y‖ ≤ ‖nearLog Y‖ + ‖Y‖²/(1 - ‖Y‖)`.

Under the small-ball hypothesis `‖Y‖ ≤ 1/3`, the tail is absorbed and yields the
coarse but robust two-sided dictionary

`‖Y‖ ≤ 2‖nearLog Y‖ ∧ ‖nearLog Y‖ ≤ 2‖Y‖`.

This matches the formal need behind the large-field cutoff translation
highlighted in Lluis Eriksson's `ai.vixra:2602.0056` (Lemma 2.1 shape:
Hilbert-Schmidt deviation versus principal logarithm), but in the repository it
is proved at the existing Banach-algebra `nearLog` level and consumed only as a
local analytic comparison.  It also reinforces the semantic correction already
made in `Ubar.lean`: `Ubar` averages `nearLog (rep(D).val - 1)`.

**Honest scope.** This does **not** prove the matrix principal-log theorem for
`SU(N)` with Hilbert-Schmidt constants, and it does **not** prove the interface

This addendum records the first theorem-fed brick of the direct covariance
route suggested by the latest Eriksson-paper audit.  The useful mathematical
step is not the broad interpretive thermodynamic language, but the concrete
Hilbert-space operator that a Gaussian block kernel consumes:

`qMassCLM = (sQ)†(sQ)`.

The implementation deliberately does **not** reuse the older `linAvgCLM`
directly, because the plain function space carries Mathlib's sup norm and does
not expose the Hilbert adjoint wanted here.  Instead the new module
`YangMills/RG/AveragingAdjoint.lean` defines fine and coarse bond fields on the
finite-dimensional `ℓ²`/`PiLp 2` Hilbert spaces, keeps the scalar rescaling
`s : ℝ` explicit, and proves:

* `inner_qMassCLM_self`:
  `⟪A, Q†Q A⟫ = ‖Q A‖²`;
* `qMassCLM_psd`: the adjoint mass is positive semidefinite;
* `qMassCLM_opNorm_le`: `‖Q†Q‖ ≤ ‖Q‖²`.

This is the deterministic mass/coercivity algebra behind a future
`GaussianBlockKernel` or finite-range `Q†Q` kernel theorem.

**Honest scope.** This does **not** prove the gauge-fixed Hessian is coercive,

This addendum records the green, low-risk part of the supersymmetry audit.  It
does **not** add a supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to the verified core.
Instead it formalizes the algebraic cancellation pattern that could later feed
the existing `hRpoly` consumers:

`H_X = Q B_X + R_X`, then integrate/cancel before taking norms.

`ApproxWardComplex` carries a continuous linear operator `Q`, an expectation
functional, and a quantitative Ward-defect estimate

`‖expect (Q F)‖ ≤ defect * ‖F‖`.

The exact theorem `expect_Q_eq_zero_of_defect_eq_zero` proves true Ward
cancellation when `defect = 0`.  The main approximate theorem
`expect_decomposition_bound` proves

`‖expect H‖ ≤ defect * ‖B‖ + ‖expect R‖`

from `H = Q B + R`.  The profile theorem
`expect_decomposition_profile_bound` lifts this pointwise to indexed activity
families: if `B` and `expect R` obey the same profile `w X`, then the integrated
activity obeys that profile with amplitude `defect * Bamp + Ramp`.

`ActivityLimit.lean` adds the corresponding regulator/decoupling consumer:
if complex activities are uniformly bounded by a profile and converge
pointwise, the limit obeys the same profile bound.

This addendum records the architectural split suggested by the kinetic-sweep
audit.  The mass-gap assembly consumes a scalar terminal estimate, while the
with-holes polymer construction is only one possible producer of that estimate.
The new module `YangMills/RG/SingleScaleUVDecay.lean` names the three layers:

* `RawYMActivityDecay` — the pre-renormalized fluctuation-integral activity
  profile;
* `RenormalizedHoleActivityDecay` — the Appendix-F output profile for
  renormalized with-holes activities;
* `SingleScaleUVDecay` — the scalar per-scale estimate actually consumed by
  `UVMassGap`.

The theorem `singleScaleUVDecay_of_renormalizedHoleActivities` proves the real
summation bridge: if `Rsc t k = ∑' Y, Hsharp t k Y`, the activities are
absolutely summable, each `Hsharp` obeys the renormalized with-holes profile,
and `∑' Y, w Y ≤ K₀`, then the scalar `SingleScaleUVDecay` holds with amplitude
`A * K₀`.  The proof consumes the already-verified `polymer_remainder_bound`,
so it is not merely a definitional wrapper.

The theorem `lattice_mass_gap_of_singleScaleUVDecay_geometric` restates the
geometric-coupling assembly through the named scalar predicate, so future
producers can feed the existing mass-gap theorem without being forced through a
specific activity representation.

**Honest scope.** This does **not** prove raw Yang-Mills activity decay,
Appendix F, direct covariance identities, Hessian coercivity, continuum limit,
or OS/Wightman reconstruction.  It is an interface and verified summation

This addendum closes the first constructive F.1 substrate recommended by the
kinetic-sweep audit: represent locality in the types, not as a late global
`DependsOnlyOn` proposition.  The new module
`YangMills/RG/LocalFunctional.lean` defines:

* `RestrictedField S V := ∀ x : {x // x ∈ S}, V x.1`;
* `LocalFunctional Site V α`, whose `eval` can only inspect a field restricted
  to its finite `support`;
* `LocalActivity Site Ψ Φ α`, with separate spectator and fluctuation supports;
* global adapters back to full fields;
* finite sums/products via support unions, including a finite-product
  constructor over a subtype-indexed cover.

The locality bridges are theorem-fed.  `globalEval_eq_of_agreeOn` for both
`LocalFunctional` and `LocalActivity` proves that changing global fields outside
the declared support cannot change the value.  The product theorems
`globalEval_finsetProd` prove that the typed finite product evaluates as the
product of global evaluations while carrying the union of supports.

**Honest scope.** This is the algebraic locality substrate for a future
constructive Dimock-F.1 compiler.  It does **not** define `rawMayer`,

This addendum closes the next local F.1 substrate after Addendum 147.  The new
module `YangMills/RG/RawMayerWithHoles.lean` defines the raw Mayer transform
`H ↦ exp H - 1` on both:

* scalar complex `LocalFunctional` values;
* scalar complex two-field `LocalActivity` values.

Because the transform is implemented by `map`, the finite supports are
preserved by construction.  The theorems
`rawMayer_globalEval_eq_of_agreeOn` for both substrates prove that the Mayer
activity remains insensitive to off-support changes in the relevant global
fields.  The theorems `norm_globalEval_rawMayer_le_two` import the elementary
Mathlib estimate `‖exp z - 1‖ ≤ 2‖z‖` under the smallness hypothesis
`‖z‖ ≤ 1`, providing the first local analytic bound for future activity
decay.

This addendum closes the next algebraic step in the constructive F.1 ladder.
The new module `YangMills/RG/OmegaConnectedCover.lean` defines:

* `omegaOverlapGraph Ω activeSupport`, the graph on cover indices whose edges
  mean that two active supports intersect inside Ω;
* `omegaConnectedIndex`, a walk-connectedness predicate in that graph;
* `OmegaConnectedCover`, a source-shaped package carrying the finite index set,
  Ω, active supports, and the connectedness certificate;
* `LocalActivity.mayerCoverActivity I H`, the finite product of raw Mayer
  activities `∏ᵢ (exp Hᵢ - 1)`;
* `OmegaConnectedCover.mayerActivity`, the same product attached to a
  connected cover package.

The cover product is theorem-fed: its spectator and fluctuation supports are
the corresponding support unions, `globalEval_mayerCoverActivity` and
`globalEval_mayerActivity` evaluate it as the product of the raw Mayer factors,
and the off-support invariance theorems prove that changing either field
outside those unions cannot change the value.

**Honest scope.** The Ω-connectedness condition is recorded but no quantitative
Appendix-F estimate is claimed.  This does **not** prove ultralocal

This addendum records the verified salvage of the SUSY/Ward acceleration idea.
The external delivery package supplied for audit was not applied as a patch:
its unified patch was empty, it contained no Lean source files, and its own
build log reported a no-toolchain/no-repository failure.  The useful idea was
therefore reconstructed directly in the repo as a compiled Lean module.

The new module `YangMills/SUSY/WardPolymer.lean` connects the abstract
`ApproxWardComplex` layer to the literal `Ω`-active skeleton-tail consumer.  It
proves the finite Ward-defect summation estimate, packages the integrated
activity `wardActivity W Hraw = fun X => W.expect (Hraw X)`, derives the
pointwise modified-metric bound from approximate and exact Ward decompositions,
and feeds both forms directly into
`omegaClusterSkeletonRemainderSum_tsum_le_metric_bound`.

**Honest scope.** This does not construct supersymmetric Yang--Mills,
Grassmann/Berezin integration, a regulator, a concrete decomposition

This addendum closes the telescopic variant requested by the SUSY/Ward
acceleration plan.  The finite theorem proves that if
`‖z 0 X‖ ≤ amp * profile X` and each increment satisfies
`‖z (n+1) X - z n X‖ ≤ B n * profile X`, then

`‖z N X‖ ≤ (amp + ∑_{n<N} B n) * profile X`.

The limit theorem adds nonnegativity of the profile and `B`, summability of
`B`, the bound `∑' n, B n ≤ S`, and pointwise convergence `z n X → zLim X`,
and concludes

`‖zLim X‖ ≤ (amp + S) * profile X`.

This is the regulator-removal consumer needed by future Ward/decoupling
arguments: profile-bounded approximation error budgets add to the final
amplitude rather than requiring a fresh cluster-expansion proof.

This addendum adds the finite ultralocal independence step for the type-local
F.1 substrate.  The new module `YangMills/RG/UltralocalFactorization.lean`
reuses the existing product-measure factorization theorem from
`YangMills/L1_GibbsMeasure/EdgeFactorization.lean` and packages it for:

* two `LocalFunctional`s with disjoint finite supports; and
* two `LocalActivity`s with disjoint fluctuation supports, with the spectator
  field held fixed.

Both theorems factorize the integral of a product under an explicit finite
`Measure.pi` probability measure.  This gives future fluctuation-integral and
polymer compilers a theorem-fed ultralocal independence brick instead of
requiring them to restate support-dependence by hand.

**Honest scope.** This is finite product-measure independence only.  It does
not construct the Yang-Mills Gaussian fluctuation measure, prove covariance
decay, prove Dimock Appendix F, establish the renormalized activity bound
`hRpoly`, continuum limit, or OS/Wightman reconstruction.  Clay distance

This addendum connects the type-local Mayer-cover product to the ultralocal
product-measure independence theorem.  The new module
`YangMills/RG/MayerCoverFactorization.lean` proves that two finite products of
raw Mayer activities factorize under an explicit `Measure.pi` fluctuation
measure when their fluctuation-support unions are disjoint.  The pairwise
version derives that union disjointness from pairwise disjoint factor supports,
which is the natural output shape for a disconnected-cover compiler.

The same bridge is packaged for `OmegaConnectedCover.mayerActivity`: the
Ω-connectedness certificates remain part of the cover objects, while the
factorization hypothesis is exactly disjointness of the actual fluctuation
dependencies.

**Honest scope.** This is finite ultralocal independence for disconnected
Mayer-cover components.  It does not prove Dimock Appendix F, the
renormalized activity estimate, the Yang-Mills fluctuation integral,
continuum limit, or OS/Wightman reconstruction.  Clay distance

core 8283)

This addendum adds the next finite compiler step on top of Addendum 153.  The
new evaluation theorem proves that a raw Mayer-cover product over a disjoint
union of index sets splits pointwise into the product of the two subcover
products.  The integration theorem combines that split with the ultralocal
factorization bridge: if the two index blocks are disjoint and every
fluctuation support in the first block is disjoint from every fluctuation
support in the second block, then the integral of the product over the union
equals the product of the two subcover integrals.

This is the finite "disconnected cover" reduction that future Appendix-F work
can consume before imposing the source-specific Ω-connectedness and
quantitative polymer-loss estimates.

**Honest scope.** This is still finite algebra plus product-measure
independence.  It does not prove the Appendix-F convergence theorem, the
renormalized activity estimate, the Yang-Mills fluctuation integral,

core 8283)

This addendum adds the finite graph criterion for disconnected Mayer-cover
components.  The new `fluctuationOverlapGraph` has an edge exactly when two
type-local activities have overlapping fluctuation supports.  If two disjoint
index blocks have no cross-edge in this graph, then
`pairwise_disjoint_fluctuationSupport_of_no_cross_adj` supplies the pairwise
cross-support disjointness hypothesis consumed by Addendum 154.  The
integrated theorem
`mayerCoverActivity_union_integral_of_no_cross_fluctuationAdj` packages the
result as a graph-theoretic disconnected-cover split.

This is the finite connected-component extraction precursor for future F.1 /
Appendix-F work: a source-specific compiler may identify disconnected blocks
in the fluctuation-overlap graph and feed them directly to the existing
ultralocal factorization theorem.

**Honest scope.** This is still finite graph algebra plus product-measure

`YangMills.RG.LocalActivity.mayerCoverActivity_integral_split_confinedComponent`;
core 8283)

This addendum adds the component-extraction producer for Addendum 155.  The
generic finite definitions `confinedReachable` and `confinedComponent` describe
the component of a root `r` inside a finite index set `K`, using only walks
whose support stays in `K`.  The graph lemma
`no_adj_confinedComponent_compl` proves that no edge can run from this
component to a vertex of `K` outside it: otherwise appending that edge to the
confined walk would put the outside vertex back in the component.

For the fluctuation-overlap graph of a family of local activities, the theorem
`mayerCoverActivity_integral_split_confinedComponent` uses this lemma to split
the Mayer-cover integral over `K` into the integral over the root component
times the integral over the complement `K \ I`.  Thus the finite disconnected
component compiler no longer needs an externally supplied no-cross-edge
hypothesis for a root component; it derives it from confined reachability.

**Honest scope.** This is finite graph/component algebra plus the already
proved product-measure independence.  It does not identify the actual
Appendix-F polymers of Yang-Mills, prove any quantitative polymer loss,
construct the fluctuation measure, establish `hRpoly`, continuum limit, or
OS/Wightman reconstruction.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

This addendum upgrades the root-component split of Addendum 156 into a finite
all-components decomposition.  The new reachability lemmas
`confinedReachable_refl`, `confinedReachable_symm`, and
`confinedReachable_trans` make the confined-walk relation usable as an
equivalence relation on a finite cover set `K`.  The new finite set
`confinedComponents G K` collects all confined components generated by roots
in `K`.

The theorem `biUnion_confinedComponents_eq` proves that these components cover
exactly `K`.  The theorem `confinedComponents_eq_of_nonempty_inter` proves
that two such components with a common vertex are equal, and
`disjoint_of_mem_confinedComponents_ne` packages the contrapositive as
disjointness of distinct components.  This is the finite partition substrate
needed before an n-ary Mayer-cover integral factorization over connected
components can replace repeated binary splitting.

**Honest scope.** This is finite graph algebra for the F.1 compiler
substrate.  At this checkpoint it did not prove the n-ary integral
factorization yet, did not
identify Dimock Appendix-F polymers, does not prove activity decay or
`hRpoly`, and does not move the continuum / OS reconstruction frontier.  Clay

core 8283)

This addendum consumes the finite partition substrate of Addendum 157.  The
new graph lemma `no_adj_of_mem_confinedComponents_ne` proves that two distinct
confined components of a finite cover set have no edge between them.  For the
fluctuation-overlap graph, this supplies exactly the no-cross-edge hypothesis
needed by the product-measure factorization theorem.

The generic theorem
`mayerCoverActivity_biUnion_integral_of_no_cross_components` proves the n-ary
finite disconnected-cover formula: for any finite family of pairwise disjoint
index blocks with no fluctuation-overlap graph edge between distinct blocks,
the Mayer-cover integral over the union of all blocks is the product of the
block integrals.  The proof is by finite induction, using the existing binary
no-cross-edge split at each step.

The consumer
`mayerCoverActivity_integral_factor_confinedComponents` instantiates that
generic theorem for the confined-component partition
`confinedComponents (fluctuationOverlapGraph H) K`.  Thus a finite Mayer cover
now factorizes directly over all its fluctuation-overlap connected components,
instead of requiring an external hand iteration of the binary root/complement
split.

**Honest scope.** This closes another finite algebra/product-measure compiler
step for the future Dimock-F.1 formalization.  It does not identify the actual
Appendix-F polymers, prove the quantitative activity loss, construct the
Yang-Mills fluctuation measure, establish `hRpoly`, continuum limit, or

This addendum closes the finite handoff from the disconnected-component
compiler back into the source-shaped Ω-cover API.  The support lemma
`mem_confinedComponent_of_mem_confinedWalk_support` shows that every vertex
appearing on a confined walk remains in the same confined component.  The
theorem `confinedComponent_walkConnected` then proves that each confined
component is walk-connected in the ambient graph.

For the Ω-overlap graph, `OmegaConnectedCover.confinedComponentCover` packages
the confined component of a root as an `OmegaConnectedCover` with the same
Ω-region and active-support map.  The theorem
`exists_confinedComponentCover_of_mem_confinedComponents` lifts every member of
`confinedComponents (omegaOverlapGraph Ω activeSupport) K` to such a cover,
so the finite all-components decomposition from Addendum 158 can hand its
blocks directly to the Ω-connected Mayer-product layer.

**Honest scope.** This is finite graph/component packaging for the future
Dimock-F.1 compiler.  It does not prove Appendix-F activity decay, construct
the Yang-Mills fluctuation measure, establish `hRpoly`, continuum limit, or
OS/Wightman reconstruction.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

This addendum records the source-facing separation fact associated to
Addendum 159.  If two finite confined components of the Ω-overlap graph are
distinct, then any index in one component and any index in the other have
disjoint active supports inside Ω:
`Disjoint (Ω ∩ activeSupport i) (Ω ∩ activeSupport j)`.  The proof combines the
existing no-edge theorem for distinct confined components with the defining
adjacency criterion of `omegaOverlapGraph`.

The pairwise wrapper packages this as the hypothesis shape expected by later
finite compiler or factorization steps.  It is the finite graph-to-source
translation layer: separated Ω-components give separated Ω-active supports.

**Honest scope.** This is finite Ω-overlap graph algebra only.  It does not
prove Appendix-F activity decay, the Yang-Mills fluctuation measure,
`hRpoly`, continuum limit, or OS/Wightman reconstruction.  Clay distance

This addendum packages Addenda 159–160 as a reusable finite family interface.
For any known member `C` of
`confinedComponents (omegaOverlapGraph Ω activeSupport) K`, the noncomputable
choice `confinedComponentCoverOfComponent` selects an `OmegaConnectedCover`
whose index is exactly `C`, whose Ω-region is `Ω`, and whose active-support map
is the original `activeSupport`.  The theorem
`mayerActivity_confinedComponentCoverOfComponent` rewrites its Mayer activity
back to `LocalActivity.mayerCoverActivity C H`.

The family wrapper `confinedComponentCoverFamily` indexes these covers by the
finite subtype of confined Ω-overlap components.  The theorem
`biUnion_confinedComponentCoverFamily_index_eq` proves that the union of the
family's cover indices is exactly the original finite cover set `K`, and
`pairwise_omegaActiveSupport_disjoint_confinedComponentCoverFamily` gives the

This addendum completes the finite partition interface for the canonical
confined-component cover family from Addendum 161.  The theorem
`disjoint_confinedComponentCoverFamily_index_of_ne` proves that distinct
entries of `confinedComponentCoverFamily Ω activeSupport K` have disjoint
index sets.  The pairwise wrapper packages the same fact in the family-indexed
form expected by later n-ary factorization and cover-product consumers.

Together with `biUnion_confinedComponentCoverFamily_index_eq`, the family now
has the exact compiler shape needed downstream: it covers all of `K` and its
component indices are pairwise disjoint.

`YangMills.RG.LocalActivity.mayerCoverActivity_integral_factor_confinedOmegaComponents_of_fluctuationSupport_subset`;
core 8283)

This addendum records the finite bridge from source-shaped Ω-components to the
measure-theoretic disconnected-cover factorization.  The theorem
`mayerCoverActivity_integral_factor_confinedOmegaComponents_of_fluctuationSupport_subset`
assumes the explicit containment
`(H i).fluctuationSupport ⊆ Ω ∩ activeSupport i` for each `i ∈ K`.  Under that
hypothesis, distinct confined components of the Ω-overlap graph have disjoint
fluctuation supports, so the ultralocal product probability measure factorizes
the Mayer-cover integral over `K` into the product over those Ω-components.

This is the exact finite adapter a later Appendix-F source compiler needs:
prove that the analytic/local construction declares active supports large
enough to contain the fluctuation dependencies, then the already-verified
component machinery supplies independence.

**Honest scope.** This is finite support algebra plus product-measure
factorization.  It does not prove the support containment for Yang-Mills,
Appendix-F activity decay, the Yang-Mills fluctuation measure, `hRpoly`,
continuum limit, or OS/Wightman reconstruction.  Clay distance

wrapper**
`YangMills.RG.OmegaConnectedCover.mayerActivity_integral_factor_confinedComponentCoverFamily_of_fluctuationSupport_subset`;
core 8283)

This addendum gives the finite F.1 compiler a source-shaped consumer for
Addendum 163.  The theorem
`mayerActivity_integral_factor_confinedComponentCoverFamily_of_fluctuationSupport_subset`
starts from the same explicit containment hypothesis
`(H i).fluctuationSupport ⊆ Ω ∩ activeSupport i` for all `i ∈ K`, but states
the resulting ultralocal Mayer-cover integral factorization directly as a
product over the canonical `confinedComponentCoverFamily`.

The proof reuses the Ω-component support bridge from Addendum 163, converts the
raw component product through `Finset.prod_attach`, and rewrites each selected
component using `mayerActivity_confinedComponentCoverOfComponent`.  This avoids
forcing later source compilers to unfold the chosen root/component witnesses by
hand.

**Honest scope.** This is finite cover-family packaging for the future
Appendix-F compiler.  It does not prove the support-containment hypothesis for
Yang-Mills, the Appendix-F activity decay, the fluctuation measure, `hRpoly`,

## Addendum 165 (2026-06-20, **support-containment edge adapter**
`YangMills.RG.LocalActivity.fluctuationOverlapGraph_adj_imp_omegaOverlapGraph_adj_of_fluctuationSupport_subset`;
core 8283)

This addendum extracts the graph-level adapter used by the Ω-component
support bridge.  The theorem
`fluctuationOverlapGraph_adj_imp_omegaOverlapGraph_adj_of_fluctuationSupport_subset`
assumes the same local containment hypotheses
`(H i).fluctuationSupport ⊆ Ω ∩ activeSupport i` and
`(H j).fluctuationSupport ⊆ Ω ∩ activeSupport j`.  Under those hypotheses, an
actual fluctuation-overlap edge between `i` and `j` implies an Ω-overlap edge
for the declared active supports.  The proof is the finite contrapositive:
if the declared Ω-active supports are disjoint, the contained fluctuation
supports are disjoint, contradicting the fluctuation edge.

This separates the source-side obligation from the measure-theoretic
factorization: a future Yang-Mills source compiler only has to prove the
support-containment statement for its local activities, and this adapter turns
actual dependencies into the Ω-cover graph relation consumed by the existing
finite F.1 machinery.

**Honest scope.** This is finite support/graph algebra.  It does not prove the
support-containment hypothesis for Yang-Mills, the Appendix-F activity decay,
the fluctuation measure, `hRpoly`, continuum limit, or OS/Wightman
reconstruction.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

`YangMills.RG.OmegaConnectedCover.mayerActivity_fluctuationSupport_subset_omega_biUnion_activeSupport`;
core 8283)

This addendum records the finite support-lifting step for the source-facing
Mayer-cover compiler.  The local theorem
`mayerCoverActivity_fluctuationSupport_subset_omega_biUnion_activeSupport`
assumes that each factor in a finite cover has fluctuation support contained
in its declared active support inside `Ω`,
`(H i).fluctuationSupport ⊆ Ω ∩ activeSupport i`.  It proves that the whole
raw-Mayer product over the cover has fluctuation support contained in
`Ω ∩ I.biUnion activeSupport`.  The `OmegaConnectedCover` theorem packages the
same statement for the cover object used by the F.1-facing APIs.

This is the local support analogue of Addendum 165: once a future
Yang-Mills source compiler proves factorwise support containment, the verified
finite layer now propagates that containment to the product activity and to
the Ω-overlap/factorization graph without redoing `biUnion` algebra.

**Honest scope.** This is finite support algebra for already-declared
supports.  It does not prove the support-containment hypothesis for
Yang-Mills, the Appendix-F activity decay, the fluctuation measure, `hRpoly`,
continuum limit, or OS/Wightman reconstruction.  Clay distance

## Addendum 167 (2026-06-20, **Mayer-cover pointwise product norm bound**

`YangMills.RG.OmegaConnectedCover.norm_globalEval_mayerActivity_le_prod_two_of_norm_le`;
core 8283)

This addendum records the finite quantitative companion to Addendum 166.
The local theorem
`norm_globalEval_mayerCoverActivity_le_prod_two_of_norm_le` assumes a
factorwise pointwise raw-activity majorant over a finite cover,
`‖(H i).globalEval ψ φ‖ ≤ A i`, together with the smallness window
`A i ≤ 1` for each `i ∈ I`.  It proves the raw Mayer-cover estimate

`‖(mayerCoverActivity I H).globalEval ψ φ‖ ≤ ∏ i : {i // i ∈ I}, 2 * A i.1`.

The proof is purely finite: rewrite the cover activity as
`∏ᵢ (exp (Hᵢ) - 1)`, use `norm_prod`, apply the already-verified one-factor
Mayer estimate `‖exp z - 1‖ ≤ 2‖z‖`, and multiply the factorwise bounds.
The `OmegaConnectedCover` theorem packages the same estimate for the
source-shaped cover object.

This gives future Appendix-F/Yang-Mills source compilers a direct quantitative
handoff: once the primary source supplies factorwise raw estimates, the
verified layer converts them into the finite product majorant without redoing
complex-norm product algebra.

**Honest scope.** This is finite complex norm algebra plus the elementary
one-factor Mayer estimate.  It does not prove the Yang-Mills raw activity
bound, the source smallness window, Appendix-F activity decay, `hRpoly`,
continuum limit, or OS/Wightman reconstruction.  Clay distance

`YangMills.RG.OmegaConnectedCover.norm_globalEval_mayerActivity_le_two_mul_pow_card_of_norm_le`;
core 8283)

This addendum specializes the Addendum 167 product bound to the common
source-facing case where every member of a finite cover has the same small
raw-activity amplitude `A`.  The local theorem
`norm_globalEval_mayerCoverActivity_le_two_mul_pow_card_of_norm_le` assumes
`‖(H i).globalEval ψ φ‖ ≤ A` for all `i ∈ I` and `A ≤ 1`, and proves

`‖(mayerCoverActivity I H).globalEval ψ φ‖ ≤ (2 * A) ^ I.card`.

The cover-facing theorem packages the same statement for
`OmegaConnectedCover`.  This is the finite cardinality profile a later
source compiler can combine with cover-size or skeleton-size estimates before
feeding the existing local-window/metric-bound KP consumers.

**Honest scope.** This is a corollary of the finite product-norm estimate,
not a Yang-Mills activity estimate.  It does not prove the source amplitude
`A`, the source smallness window, Appendix-F activity decay, `hRpoly`,
continuum limit, or OS/Wightman reconstruction.  Clay distance

`YangMills.RG.OmegaConnectedCover.norm_globalEval_mayerActivity_le_two_mul_pow_of_le_card`;
core 8283)

This addendum turns the uniform cover-size profile of Addendum 168 into the
decay form needed by future metric/skeleton compilers.  If every factor has
raw-activity amplitude `≤ A`, `0 ≤ A`, `A ≤ 1`, the one-factor Mayer cost
satisfies `2 * A ≤ 1`, and a source-side combinatorial argument proves a
lower bound `n ≤ I.card`, then

`‖(mayerCoverActivity I H).globalEval ψ φ‖ ≤ (2 * A) ^ n`.

The proof is finite real algebra: first use the verified cardinal profile
`≤ (2A)^{|I|}`, then use monotonicity of powers for a base in `[0,1]`.
The cover-facing theorem packages the same result for `OmegaConnectedCover`.

This is the exact non-model-specific bridge between a future source theorem
such as "the cover has at least the active skeleton size / modified metric"
and an exponentially small Mayer-cover product.

**Honest scope.** This is finite power monotonicity plus the Mayer product
bound.  It does not prove the source-side lower bound `n ≤ |I|`, the
Yang-Mills raw amplitude `A`, Appendix-F activity decay, `hRpoly`, continuum
limit, or OS/Wightman reconstruction.  Clay distance

`YangMills.SUSY.finiteBerezinTop_basis_of_ne_top`,
`YangMills.SUSY.finiteBerezinTop_one_of_pos`;
core 8283)

This addendum records the first concrete finite Grassmann/Berezin algebra
under the abstract Ward layer.  The new file `YangMills/SUSY/FiniteBerezin.lean`
uses Mathlib's exterior algebra over the finite complex vector space
`Fin n → ℂ`.  Its canonical basis is indexed by finite subsets of `Fin n`.

The main definition
`finiteBerezinTop n : ExteriorAlgebra ℂ (Fin n → ℂ) →ₗ[ℂ] ℂ`
is the coefficient functional of the top exterior monomial.  The verified
rules are:

* `finiteExteriorBasis_empty` identifies the empty exterior monomial with the
  unit;
* `finiteBerezinTop_basis` proves that the top-coefficient functional is `1`
  on the top basis monomial and `0` on all other exterior basis monomials;
* `finiteBerezinTop_top_basis` and `finiteBerezinTop_basis_of_ne_top` expose
  those two cases separately;
* `finiteBerezinTop_one_of_pos` proves that constants have zero finite
  Berezin integral when the fermionic dimension is positive.

This gives the Ward/SUSY track a real algebraic object beneath the previously
abstract cancellation interface: future finite super-Gaussian work can now
target an actual top-coefficient Berezin functional instead of a purely
schematic expectation symbol.

**Honest scope.** This is only the algebraic Berezin coefficient functional.
It does not construct a Gaussian Berezin weight, fermionic covariance,
Pfaffian/determinant cancellation, a regulator/decoupling theorem, the
Yang-Mills fluctuation activity bound, `hRpoly`, continuum limit, or
OS/Wightman reconstruction.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

`YangMills.SUSY.finiteBerezin_eq_expect_remainder_of_exactWard`;
core 8284)

This addendum extends the finite Berezin substrate with the exact algebraic
Ward rule for the concrete top-coefficient functional.  The file now names
the finite exterior algebra as `FiniteExterior n`, proves the scalar endpoint
rules

* `finiteBerezinTop_one_zero`: in zero fermionic dimension, `∫ 1 = 1`;
* `finiteBerezinTop_algebraMap_of_pos`: in positive fermionic dimension,
  every scalar constant has finite Berezin integral `0`;

and introduces `FiniteBerezinExactWard n`, a linear operator `Q` on
`FiniteExterior n` satisfying the exact finite Ward identity
`finiteBerezinTop n (Q F) = 0`.

The theorem `finiteBerezin_eq_expect_remainder_of_exactWard` proves the
concrete cancellation rule:

`H = Q B + R ⟹ finiteBerezinTop n H = finiteBerezinTop n R`.

This is the finite Berezin analogue of the exact branch of
`ApproxWardComplex`, but deliberately remains algebraic: no artificial
norm/topology is placed on Mathlib's exterior algebra merely to fit a
continuous-linear API.

**Honest scope.** This is exact algebraic Ward cancellation for a finite
top-coefficient functional.  It does not construct the Ward differential from
a physical supersymmetry, prove Gaussian Berezin determinant/Pfaffian
identities, bound any Yang-Mills activity, discharge `hRpoly`, or affect the

core 8284)

This addendum adds the algebraic weighted Berezin functional

`finiteBerezinWeighted n weight F = finiteBerezinTop n (weight * F)`.

The theorem `finiteBerezinWeighted_one` proves that unit weight recovers the
unweighted top-coefficient functional.  The new structure
`FiniteBerezinWeightedExactWard n weight` then packages an exact finite Ward
identity for this weighted functional, and
`finiteBerezinWeighted_eq_expect_remainder_of_exactWard` proves the weighted
cancellation rule:

`H = Q B + R ⟹ ∫_weight H = ∫_weight R`.

This is the next finite-dimensional substrate needed before a super-Gaussian
toy model: future work can instantiate `weight` by an exterior-algebra
Gaussian weight and then prove, from primary finite Berezin algebra, the
determinant/Pfaffian cancellation identities.

**Honest scope.** The weight is only an algebraic multiplier.  This checkpoint
does not construct a covariance, prove a Gaussian Berezin determinant/Pfaffian
formula, instantiate a physical supersymmetry, bound any Yang-Mills activity,
discharge `hRpoly`, or affect the continuum Clay obligations.  Clay distance

core 8284)

This addendum adds the first concrete weighted-density seed for the finite
Berezin substrate:

`finiteBerezinTopWeight n a = 1 + a • finiteExteriorBasis n univ`.

The theorem `finiteBerezinWeighted_top_basis_one` proves that weighting by the
top exterior basis monomial integrates the constant observable `1` to `1`.
The theorem `finiteBerezinTopWeight_zero` records that zero top coefficient is
the unit density.  In positive fermionic dimension,
`finiteBerezinWeighted_topWeight_one_of_pos` proves

`∫_(finiteBerezinTopWeight n a) 1 = a`,

and `finiteBerezinWeighted_topWeight_algebraMap_of_pos` proves the scalar
normalization rule

`∫_(finiteBerezinTopWeight n a) z = a * z`.

This is a small but concrete preparation for finite super-Gaussian work: a
future exterior-algebra Gaussian weight must reduce to explicit top-degree
coefficients before any determinant/Pfaffian cancellation theorem can be
honestly stated.

**Honest scope.** This is top-degree density normalization only.  It does not

supersymmetry, Yang-Mills activity bound, `hRpoly`, continuum limit, or
OS/Wightman reconstruction.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 174 (2026-06-20, **finite Berezin generator nilpotence**
`YangMills.SUSY.finiteExteriorBasis_singleton_mul_self`;
core 8284)

This addendum records the first generator-level Grassmann algebra theorem in
the finite Berezin substrate.  For every finite fermionic dimension and every
generator index `i`, the degree-one exterior basis monomial squares to zero:

`e_i * e_i = 0`.

The proof uses Mathlib's exterior-algebra basis multiplication theorem for
non-disjoint exterior basis monomials, avoiding any sign-convention shortcut.
This is a basic input for future finite Gaussian/Pfaffian work: any honest
finite Berezin Gaussian expansion needs the nilpotence of repeated generators
before pairings and top-degree coefficients can be computed.

**Honest scope.** This is only generator nilpotence in the finite exterior
algebra.  It does not prove a Gaussian Berezin integral, determinant/Pfaffian
formula, physical supersymmetry, Yang-Mills activity bound, `hRpoly`,
continuum limit, or OS/Wightman reconstruction.  Clay distance

`YangMills.SUSY.finiteBerezinTop_powersetCard_mul_of_disjoint_top`;
core 8284)

This addendum generalizes the previous singleton nilpotence brick into the
finite exterior-basis product API needed for explicit Berezin expansions.

* If two basis monomials have overlapping generator support, their product is
  zero.
* Consequently, the Berezin top coefficient of such a product is zero.
* If two cardinality-indexed basis monomials are disjoint, their product is the
  exterior basis monomial of the disjoint union multiplied by Mathlib's explicit
  permutation sign.
* If that disjoint union is the full generator set, the Berezin top coefficient
  of the product is exactly the same explicit orientation sign acting on
  `(1 : ℂ)`.

The disjoint case intentionally leaves the orientation sign visible.  This
avoids the earlier rejected shortcut through concrete decision-procedure signs
and sets up finite Gaussian/Pfaffian identities so their sign conventions
remain auditable.

**Honest scope.** These are algebraic exterior-basis product rules only.  They
do not prove a Gaussian Berezin integral, determinant/Pfaffian formula,
physical supersymmetry, Yang-Mills activity bound, `hRpoly`, continuum limit,
or OS/Wightman reconstruction.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

`YangMills.SUSY.finiteBerezinWeighted_topWeight_basis_of_nonempty_ne_top`;
core 8284)

This addendum computes the elementary top-density weight

`finiteBerezinTopWeight n a = 1 + a • topBasis`

on exterior basis monomials in positive fermionic dimension.

* The top basis monomial annihilates any nonempty basis monomial on either
  side, by repeated-generator nilpotence.
* The empty basis monomial integrates to the prescribed coefficient `a`.
* The top basis monomial integrates to `1`.
* Every nonempty, non-top basis monomial integrates to `0`.

This makes the toy finite Berezin density genuinely usable as a basis-level
coefficient extractor before any Gaussian/Pfaffian determinant statement is
attempted.

**Honest scope.** This is still only finite exterior-algebra bookkeeping for a
top-degree density seed.  It does not construct a Gaussian Berezin integral,
determinant/Pfaffian formula, physical supersymmetry, Yang-Mills activity

core 8284)

This addendum promotes the previous basis-by-basis top-density computation into
a global linear identity on the finite exterior algebra.  The new
`finiteBerezinEmptyCoeff` reads the coefficient of the empty exterior monomial,
and in positive fermionic dimension the elementary density

`finiteBerezinTopWeight n a = 1 + a • topBasis`

acts by

`finiteBerezinTop + a • finiteBerezinEmptyCoeff`.

Equivalently, integrating an arbitrary finite exterior element against that
weight extracts its top coefficient and adds `a` times its empty coefficient.
This is a small but useful interface for later finite Gaussian/Pfaffian
expansions, where weights must be reduced to coefficient extraction before any
determinant identity can be stated honestly.

**Honest scope.** This is a finite-dimensional linear coefficient identity for
the toy top-density seed.  It does not construct a Gaussian Berezin integral,
fermionic covariance, determinant/Pfaffian formula, physical supersymmetry,
Yang-Mills activity bound, `hRpoly`, continuum limit, or OS/Wightman

core 8284)

This addendum evaluates the elementary top-density weight on products of
finite exterior basis monomials.

* If the two supports overlap, repeated-generator nilpotence kills the product,
  so the weighted Berezin integral is zero.
* If the supports are disjoint and their union is the full generator set in
  positive fermionic dimension, the weighted integral is exactly Mathlib's
  explicit exterior orientation sign.
* If the disjoint union is nonempty but not top-degree, the weighted integral
  is zero.

These are deliberately sign-exposed product rules.  They are meant to feed a
future finite Gaussian/Pfaffian expansion without hiding the orientation
convention in an opaque decision procedure.

**Honest scope.** This is finite exterior-algebra coefficient bookkeeping for
the toy top-density seed.  It does not construct a Gaussian Berezin integral,
fermionic covariance, determinant/Pfaffian formula, physical supersymmetry,
Yang-Mills activity bound, `hRpoly`, continuum limit, or OS/Wightman

`YangMills.SUSY.finiteBerezinWeighted_sum_basis_mul_sum_basis`;
core 8284)

This addendum lifts the finite Berezin monomial calculus to finite coefficient
expansions.

* `finiteBerezinTop` applied to a finite exterior-basis sum selects the
  coefficient of the top monomial if it is present in the finite index set, and
  gives zero otherwise.
* `finiteBerezinEmptyCoeff` does the same for the empty monomial; the same
  functional also sends the algebra unit to one.
* In positive fermionic dimension, the elementary top-density weight
  `1 + a • topBasis` applied to a finite basis sum is exactly
  `top coefficient + a * empty coefficient`.
* For any algebraic weight, the weighted finite Berezin integral of the product
  of two finite basis sums expands bilinearly as the double sum of the weighted
  monomial-product integrals.

These theorems are intended as the finite-sum bridge between the existing
sign-exposed monomial rules and a later tiny Gaussian/Pfaffian toy expansion.

**Honest scope.** This is still finite exterior-algebra coefficient
bookkeeping.  It does not construct a Gaussian Berezin integral, fermionic
covariance, determinant/Pfaffian formula, physical supersymmetry, Yang-Mills

This addendum combines the previous bilinear finite-sum expansion with
Grassmann nilpotence.

* Products of exterior-basis monomials with overlapping generator support
  integrate to zero against any algebraic Berezin weight.
* Therefore the weighted Berezin integral of a product of two finite
  exterior-basis sums can be rewritten as a double sum filtered by
  `Disjoint s t`.
* The same filtered form is exposed for the elementary top-density weight.

This is the next mechanical bridge toward finite Gaussian/Pfaffian toy
expansions: coefficient sums can now discard repeated-generator pairs before
the surviving disjoint monomial terms are handed to the sign/top-degree rules.

**Honest scope.** This is finite exterior-algebra bookkeeping.  It does not

core 8287)

This addendum closes the exact finite target-family Fubini/lumping identity
for the single-support Appendix-F compiler in
`YangMills/RG/AppendixFFiniteCover.lean`.

The new dependent left-inverse theorem proves that erasing a target choice to
its selected connected-cover family and reconstructing the target-choice datum
recovers the original choice, under the explicit active-nonempty hypothesis.
The proof uses the already-verified injectivity of the cover-union map on an
admissible connected-cover family and a small private transport lemma for
membership-indexed finite functions.

The new sum identity
`sum_appendixFAdmissibleTargetChoices_eq_sum_admissibleConnectedCoverFamilies`
then reindexes the explicit finite choice domain by admissible connected-cover
families.  Composed with the product-over-fibers expansion, this gives
`sum_admissibleTargetFamilies_prod_connectedMayerActivity_eq_sum_admissibleConnectedCoverFamilies`.
Finally,
`prod_one_add_eq_appendixFTargetPolymerSystem_partition` identifies the
single-support target hard-core gas partition with the raw finite Mayer
product, and

This addendum adds `YangMills/RG/AppendixFHoleTarget.lean`, the first finite
two-support bridge for the concrete `omegaHolePolymerSystem` carrier.

The new module proves that the skeleton of a full connected-cover union is
exactly the connected-cover union of the active skeletons:

```
skeleton HF (appendixFCoverUnion (fun X => X.val) C)
  = appendixFCoverUnion (fun X => skeleton HF X.val) C
```

It also proves that every connected cover has a nonempty full target, that
representable full targets are cube-connected, respect the hole family, and
have nonempty active skeleton, and packages them back as `OmegaPolymerType`.
Most importantly for the forthcoming two-support Fubini theorem, an
admissible family whose disjointness is only active-skeleton disjointness
cannot contain two distinct connected covers with the same full target union.
The map from connected covers to full targets is therefore `Set.InjOn` on the
admissible family, and its image preserves cardinality.

core 8289)

This addendum adds `YangMills/RG/AppendixFHoleTargetFamily.lean`, the exact
finite two-support target-family compiler for `omegaHolePolymerSystem`.

The new module uses active skeletons for the Appendix-F compatibility relation
and full hole-polymer unions for target fibers:

```
overlapSupport X = skeleton HF X.val
targetSupport  X = X.val
activePart     Y = skeleton HF Y
```

It defines the connected Mayer activity by full target `Y`, admissible
full-target families whose active skeletons are pairwise disjoint, and the
dependent target-choice domain.  The main proof shows that erasing a target
choice to its selected connected-cover family and then reconstructing the
canonical full-target choice is a dependent left inverse, relying on the
full-target injectivity theorem from Addendum 182.  Conversely, reconstructing
from an admissible connected-cover family and erasing returns the original
family.

Consequently, the explicit finite choice sum is reindexed by admissible
connected-cover families:

```
sum_appendixFHoleAdmissibleTargetChoices_eq_sum_admissibleConnectedCoverFamilies
```

Composing this with the product-over-fibers expansion gives the two-support
target-family identity
`sum_appendixFHoleAdmissibleTargetFamilies_prod_connectedMayerActivity_eq_sum_admissibleConnectedCoverFamilies`.
Finally, the finite raw Mayer product is recovered as
`prod_one_add_eq_sum_appendixFHoleAdmissibleTargetFamilies`, with the
exponential specialization
`complex_exp_sum_eq_sum_appendixFHoleAdmissibleTargetFamilies`.

This addendum adds `YangMills/RG/AppendixFQuantitative.lean`, the first finite
quantitative layer above the Appendix-F target-family compiler.

The new theorem
`norm_appendixFComponentWeight_expSubOne_le_metricProduct` proves the one-cover
product estimate: if each raw term satisfies

```
‖h i‖ ≤ H0 * Real.exp (-κ * metric i)
```

with `0 ≤ H0`, `H0 ≤ 1`, and `0 ≤ κ`, then the raw Mayer product
`∏ i ∈ C, (exp (h i) - 1)` is bounded by the product of the factorwise weights
`∏ i ∈ C, 2H0 * exp(-κ metric i)`.  The proof uses the already-verified
small raw-Mayer inequality `‖exp z - 1‖ ≤ 2‖z‖` and no source-specific
constant.

The finite first-activity theorem
`norm_appendixFConnectedActivity_le_metricCoverSum` then applies the triangle
inequality over the target fiber and collapses the product weights to

```
Σ C in appendixFTargetFiber Ω overlapSupport targetSupport Λ Y,
  (2 * H0) ^ C.card * Real.exp (-κ * Σ i ∈ C, metric i).
```

The source-facing specialization
`norm_appendixFHoleConnectedMayerActivity_expSubOne_le_metricCoverSum` applies
the same bound to the with-holes carrier: active skeletons control
Ω-connectivity, while full hole-polymer unions control the target fiber.

**Honest scope.** This proves a finite triangle/product-norm majorant for the

core 8290)

This addendum extends `YangMills/RG/AppendixFQuantitative.lean` with the finite
localization bridge immediately after Addendum 184's metric-cover majorant.

The new definitions package the repeated right-hand sides:

* `appendixFMetricCoverWeight metric H0 κ C`
* `appendixFTargetMetricCoverSum Ω overlapSupport targetSupport Λ metric Y H0 κ`
* `appendixFPinnedMetricCoverSum Ω overlapSupport targetSupport Λ metric r H0 κ`

The pinned sum ranges over all connected raw covers containing at least one
raw target support through the chosen site `r`.  The finite theorem
`appendixFTargetMetricCoverSum_le_pinnedMetricCoverSum` proves the elementary
but important local-influence step: if `r ∈ Y`, every cover in the target
fiber over `Y` contributes to the pinned cover domain, since its target union
is exactly `Y`.  The proof uses only finite set inclusion plus positivity of
the metric cover weight.

Composing this localization with Addendum 184 gives
`norm_appendixFConnectedActivity_le_pinnedMetricCoverSum`, and the source-facing
with-holes theorem
`norm_appendixFHoleConnectedMayerActivity_expSubOne_le_pinnedMetricCoverSum`.
For `omegaHolePolymerSystem`, this says: active skeletons control
Ω-connectivity, full hole-polymer unions control targets, and any pin `r ∈ Y`
dominates the first activity by a local pinned connected-cover sum through
`r`.

**Honest scope.** This is still finite localization, not Dimock's analytic

core 8290)

This addendum extends `YangMills/RG/AppendixFQuantitative.lean` with the finite
geometric stitching step for the source-facing Appendix-F with-holes carrier.

The reusable variational lemma
`discreteModifiedMetric_add_one_le_card_of_spanning_set` proves that any finite
connected set `S` spanning the active skeleton of a full polymer `X` bounds the
repository's modified metric:

```
discreteModifiedMetric HF X + 1 ≤ S.card.
```

The main cover theorem
`appendixFHoleCoverUnion_discreteModifiedMetric_add_one_le_sum` applies this
to an active-skeleton connected cover of `OmegaPolymerType` polymers.  For each
raw polymer it chooses a minimal connected skeleton-spanning set, then uses the
already-proved `walk_union_connected` transport along the Appendix-F
Ω-overlap graph to show that the union of those spanning sets is connected.
Together with subadditivity of finite-cardinality under `biUnion`, this gives
the finite shifted metric inequality

```
d_M(⋃ full targets, mod holes) + 1
  ≤ Σ_X (d_M(X, mod holes) + 1).
```

The fiber theorem
`appendixFHoleTargetFiber_discreteModifiedMetric_add_one_le_sum` rewrites the
full target union as the target `Y`, yielding the exact source-facing form

```
d_M(Y, mod holes) + 1
  ≤ Σ_{X in C} (d_M(X, mod holes) + 1)
```

for every `C ∈ appendixFTargetFiber` built from active skeletons and full
hole-polymer targets.

## Addendum 187 (2026-06-20, **adversarial Dimock-Balaban source-claim
audit**; documentation only; core 8290)

This addendum adds `docs/SOURCE-CLAIM-AUDIT.md` and cross-links it from
`CURRENT-STATE.md`, `docs/BALABAN-SOURCE-BOUNDS.md`,
`HYPOTHESIS_FRONTIER.md`, and `README-FOR-NEXT-MODEL.md`.

The audit records contradicted source attributions, the replacement
Dimock-facing statements, the still-pending Balaban extraction queue, and the
provenance fields required before any source statement may be promoted from
`source-pending` to source-verified input.  It is intentionally adversarial:
source extraction is not a Lean proof, scalar `phi^4_3` constants are not
Yang-Mills constants, and polymer-local Balaban bounds are not a scalar
`hRpoly` theorem until the exact support/activity bridge is built.

No Lean theorem was added, no oracle entry changed, no build-job increase is
claimed, and no source-pending Balaban statement was promoted.  The live P3
frontier is now stated as: theorem-fed finite metric stitching in the source
shape of (641), followed by the open connected-cover summation to (642),
`K#`, `H#`, and the final loss.  P4 remains the concrete Yang-Mills raw
activity estimate for the actual gauge RG operator.

This addendum closes the next safe part of the averaging-adjoint frontier.  The
linear RG averaging operator `Q` already had its pointwise locality theorem in
quantified form.  This checkpoint names the finite stencils explicitly:

* `fineLineSupport L N' μ x`, the `L` positively-oriented fine bonds read by a
  line integral from `x` in direction `μ`;
* `linAvgSupport L N' c`, the finite block/line stencil read by `linAvg` at
  coarse bond `c`.

The new theorem `linAvg_congr_of_eqOn_support` packages locality as agreement
on that finite stencil.  `scaledLinAvgCLM_congr_of_eqOn_support` lifts the same
finite-stencil locality to the Hilbert-space operator used to form
`qMassCLM = Q†Q`, keeping the scalar normalization `s` explicit.

`YangMills.RG.gaussianBlockTransform_isProbability`; core 8291)

This addendum adds `YangMills/RG/GaussianBlockKernel.lean`, a small
measure-theoretic brick for the Balaban/Appendix-F route.  For a continuous
linear averaging map `Q`, a fluctuation law `γ`, and a coarse field `A`, the
conditional block law is the translate of `γ` by `Q A`.  The full finite block
transform samples `A ∼ μ` and `ξ ∼ γ` independently and pushes the product
measure forward by `(A, ξ) ↦ Q A + ξ`.

The new theorem-fed facts are:

* `gaussianBlockKernel_isProbability`: a translated probability fluctuation law
  is still a probability conditional block kernel;
* `gaussianBlockTransform_isProbability`: the finite product block transform is
  a probability measure when both input laws are probability measures.

This addendum strengthens `YangMills/RG/GaussianBlockKernel.lean` without
adding analytic assumptions.  The finite block map
`(coarse field, fluctuation) |-> Q coarse field + fluctuation` is now exposed
as the continuous linear map `gaussianBlockCLM Q`, and the block transform is
defined as the pushforward along this map.

The new theorem-fed facts are:

* `gaussianBlockKernel_isGaussian`: if the fluctuation law is Gaussian, then
  every translated conditional block kernel is Gaussian;
* `gaussianBlockTransform_isGaussian`: if the coarse law and fluctuation law
  are Gaussian, then their independent finite block transform is Gaussian.

The proof uses Mathlib's existing Gaussian closure under translation, product
measures, and continuous linear maps.  No source constants or Yang-Mills
normalizations are introduced.

This addendum follows the latest Appendix-F strategy handoff by introducing the
first defined `K -> K#` layer before attempting the second polymer gas.

The type-local substrate now has:

* `LocalActivity.finsetSum`, a finite sum of local activities whose spectator
  and fluctuation supports are the corresponding finite support unions;
* `LocalActivity.integrateFluctuation`, integrating the fluctuation field
  against the ultralocal product measure to produce a spectator-field
  `LocalFunctional`;
* `LocalActivity.norm_globalEval_integrateFluctuation_le_of_norm_le`, carrying
  an explicit `Integrable` hypothesis and proving that a uniform pointwise
  bound transfers through the probability integral.

The new module `YangMills/RG/AppendixFKsharp.lean` defines
`appendixFHoleConnectedLocalActivity`, the type-local version of the already
proved scalar connected target-fiber activity.  Its evaluation theorem states
that global evaluation is exactly
`appendixFHoleConnectedMayerActivity` with the pointwise raw Mayer factors
`exp (H X) - 1`.  The module then defines
`appendixFHoleKsharp` as the fluctuation integral of this local activity and
proves `norm_appendixFHoleKsharp_globalEval_le`.

This addendum adds `YangMills/RG/AppendixFFiberEntropy.lean`, the finite
combinatorial entropy step immediately after the Appendix-F connected-activity
majorant and metric stitching.

The new module proves:

* skeleton monotonicity under full-polymer inclusion;
* every target fiber is contained in the nonempty powerset of raw indices whose
  full target support is contained in the target `Y`;
* the elementary nonempty-powerset product bound
  `sum prod <= exp (sum weights) - 1`;
* the target-fiber version
  `appendixFTargetFiber_prod_le_exp_sub_one`.

This is the certified finite form of the "forget connectedness/exact-union
constraints and exponentiate the remaining raw-index sum" step.  It is meant

This addendum adds `YangMills/RG/PolymerClusterWithHolesBridge.lean`, the
quantitative bookkeeping bridge from a residual Appendix-F with-holes activity
estimate to the existing scalar `hpoly` / `SingleScaleUVDecay` consumer.

The new module defines the residual rate

```
polymerClusterResidualRate κ κ₀ = κ - 3 * κ₀ - 3
```

and records the important margin distinction:

* `κ ≥ 3κ₀ + 3` proves only nonnegative residual decay;
* reusing a geometric summability estimate at exponent `κ₀` requires
  `κ₀ ≤ κ - 3κ₀ - 3`, for instance the stronger source-side condition
  `κ ≥ 4κ₀ + 3`.

It proves the static aggregate theorem
`polymerClusterWithHoles_abs_tsum_le`: a pointwise residual bound
`|H#(Y)| <= C H₀ exp (-(κ - 3κ₀ - 3) d(Y))`, together with
`Σ exp (-κ₀ d(Y)) <= K₀`, implies `Σ |H#(Y)| <= C H₀ K₀` under the explicit
margin `κ₀ <= κ - 3κ₀ - 3`.  It also proves
`singleScaleUVDecay_of_clusterWithHolesActivities`, feeding the same residual
activity estimate directly into the already verified `SingleScaleUVDecay`
interface.

This addendum extends `YangMills/RG/PolymerClusterWithHolesBridge.lean` from an
abstract metric bridge to a concrete rooted with-holes polymer bridge over the
already verified modified-metric summability theorem.

The new adapter proves the exact translation

```
exp (-(κ₀ * n)) = exp (-κ₀)^n
```

and applies it to the existing theorem
`discreteModifiedMetric_weight_summable` with `q = exp (-κ₀)`.  The resulting
bound is

```
Σ_{X : r ∈ skeleton X} exp (-κ₀ * (d_M(X)+1))
  ≤ (1 - ((3^d)^2) * (exp(-κ₀) * 2^(3^d+1)))⁻¹
```

under the existing hole-disjointness/no-cross-edge/nonempty-hole hypotheses and
the explicit coordination smallness condition
`((3^d)^2) * (exp(-κ₀) * 2^(3^d+1)) < 1`.

The final theorem
`rooted_polymerClusterWithHoles_abs_tsum_le` combines this concrete
summability with the residual margin bridge.  It is the direct rooted
`hpoly`-style aggregate estimate for activities satisfying the concrete
residual modified-metric pointwise bound.

**Honest scope.** This is still a rooted summability/aggregation adapter.  It
does not prove the analytic residual pointwise estimate, Dimock (642), the
integrated `K#` estimates, the second Ursell expansion to `H#`, or any
continuum/OS/Clay theorem.  It does, however, connect the residual bridge to
the repo's actual modified-metric polymer summability theorem instead of an
abstract `K₀` hypothesis.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

`YangMills.RG.omega_rooted_exp_discreteModifiedMetric_tsum_le`,
`YangMills.RG.omega_rooted_polymerClusterWithHoles_abs_tsum_le`; core 8294)

This addendum extends `YangMills/RG/PolymerClusterWithHolesBridge.lean` one
step closer to the Appendix-F consumer by lifting the rooted modified-metric
bridge from the plain concrete subtype

```
{X : Finset (Cube d L) // r ∈ skeleton H X ∧ cubeConnected X ∧ polymerWithHoles H X}
```

to the source-facing active polymer subtype

```
{P : OmegaPolymerType H z // r ∈ skeleton H P.val}.
```

The reusable equivalence `omegaRootedPolymerEquiv` records that the only extra
field in `OmegaPolymerType` is nonempty skeleton, supplied by the root
membership hypothesis.  The theorem
`omega_rooted_exp_discreteModifiedMetric_tsum_le` transports the concrete
summability bound to the `OmegaPolymerType` index shape, and
`omega_rooted_polymerClusterWithHoles_abs_tsum_le` applies the residual
with-holes bridge directly to rooted active Appendix-F polymers.

mismatch between the finite Appendix-F polymer type and the residual `hpoly`
bridge.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

`YangMills.RG.singleScaleUVDecay_of_omegaRootedClusterWithHolesActivities_four_mul_margin`;
core 8294)

This addendum finishes the immediate consumer-facing adapter after Addendum
195.  The rooted `OmegaPolymerType` residual bridge now feeds the scalar
`SingleScaleUVDecay` predicate consumed by the UV mass-gap assembly.

The theorem
`singleScaleUVDecay_of_omegaRootedClusterWithHolesActivities` takes a
scale-indexed rooted omega-pinned activity family

```
Hsharp : ℕ → ℕ → {P : OmegaPolymerType H z // r ∈ skeleton H P.val} → ℝ
```

together with the residual Appendix-F decay bound in the concrete modified
metric

```
d_M(P.val.val, holes) + 1
```

and the already-proved rooted geometric summability assumptions.  If

```
Rsc t k = ∑' P, Hsharp t k P,
```

then the scalar consumer receives

```
SingleScaleUVDecay Rsc g
  ((C * H₀) *
    (1 - ((3^d)^2) * (exp(-κ₀) * 2^(3^d+1)))⁻¹)
  c₀ κ₀.
```

The companion
`singleScaleUVDecay_of_omegaRootedClusterWithHolesActivities_four_mul_margin`
packages the sufficient margin `κ ≥ 4κ₀ + 3`, using the previously verified
residual inequality `κ₀ ≤ κ - 3κ₀ - 3`.

It closes the formal route from an already-supplied omega-rooted residual
activity estimate to the scalar UV hypothesis.  Clay distance **~0%

## Addendum 197 (2026-06-20, **Appendix-F local summability adapter**
`YangMills.RG.appendixFHole_rootedFiniteExpWeightSum_le`,
`YangMills.RG.appendixFHole_containedWeightSum_le_metric_mul_of_rooted`;
core 8295)

This addendum follows the dependency-order audit recommending that the first
`K#` estimate be preceded by a local modified-metric summability adapter,
rather than by the final residual `H#` bridge.  A new module
`YangMills/RG/AppendixFLocalSummability.lean` defines

```
appendixFHoleExpWeight HF κ X = exp (-(κ * (d_M(X, holes) + 1)))
appendixFKsharpRate κ κ₀ = κ - κ₀ - 2
```

The theorem `appendixFHole_rootedFiniteExpWeightSum_le` restricts the
existing rooted omega modified-metric summability theorem to any finite raw
family `Λ`.

The theorem `appendixFHole_containedWeightSum_le_metric_mul_of_rooted`
converts rooted control

```
Σ_{X ∈ Λ, r ∈ skeleton X} w(X) ≤ K₀
```

into target-contained control

```
Σ_{X ∈ Λ, X.val ⊆ Y} w(X) ≤ (d_M(Y) + 1) K₀
```

for representable Appendix-F full targets `Y`.  The proof overcounts through
roots in `skeleton HF Y`, uses `sum_biUnion_le`, and closes the root count with
`skeleton_card_le_discreteModifiedMetric_add_one`.  The local nonnegativity
hypothesis remains only on `X ∈ Λ`; internally the proof uses a zero extension
off `Λ` to reuse the existing global nonnegativity summation lemma.

core 8296)

This addendum adds `YangMills/RG/AppendixFKsharpEstimate.lean`, the first
source-shaped `K(Y)`/`K#` estimate after the local summability adapter.

The pointwise theorem
`norm_appendixFHoleConnectedLocalActivity_globalEval_le_expSubOne` combines
the existing finite ingredients:

```
raw metric decay
+ target-fiber entropy
+ with-holes metric stitching
+ target-contained local summability
```

to prove the exact nonlinear first-activity bound

```
‖K(Y, ψ, φ)‖
  ≤ exp(-(κ-κ₀)(d_M(Y)+1))
      * (exp(2 H₀ K₀ (d_M(Y)+1)) - 1).
```

The integrated theorem
`norm_appendixFHoleKsharp_globalEval_le_expSubOne_of_rawMetricDecay` transfers
the same bound to `K#(Y, ψ)` through the already verified probability-integral
bridge, with the `Integrable` hypothesis still explicit.  The rooted variant
`norm_appendixFHoleKsharp_globalEval_le_expSubOne_of_rawMetricDecay_rooted`
derives the contained-support local estimate from rooted modified-metric
summability.

**Honest scope.** This closes the exact finite nonlinear `K(Y)`/`K#` estimate
but deliberately does not prove the linearized `κ - κ₀ - 2` corollary, Dimock
(643) target-family factorization, the second hard-core target gas, the final
`H#` residual rate `κ - 3κ₀ - 3`, the concrete Yang-Mills raw activity decay,

This addendum adds `YangMills/RG/AppendixFSecondGas.lean`, the structural
second-gas layer after the first integrated activity `K#`.

The new evaluated activity
`appendixFHoleSecondGasActivity HF z Λ Hraw μ ψ Y` is definitionally
`(appendixFHoleKsharp HF z Λ Hraw μ Y).globalEval ψ`, and
`appendixFHoleSecondGas` instantiates that scalar activity through the
source-facing `omegaHolePolymerSystem`.  The theorem
`appendixFHoleSecondGas_activity` exposes this projection on the carrier, and
`appendixFHoleSecondGasActivity_eq_zero_of_not_mem_targetRegion` proves that
nonrepresentable first-stage targets have zero activity.

The KP entry point is intentionally not called Dimock (642):
`AppendixFHoleSecondGasKPMajorant` includes the exact tilt and full-cardinality
factor required by the current `omegaHolePolymerSystem` KP consumer.  The
theorem `appendixFHoleSecondGas_KPCriterion_of_majorant` then applies
`omegaHolePolymerSystem_KPCriterion_volumeUniform_skeleton_exp_of_metric_bound`
directly under the explicit geometry, smallness, and pointwise-majorant
hypotheses.

Dimock (642), the ultralocal product factorization (643), the Ursell-defined

`YangMills.RG.appendixFHoleHsharpOfKsharp_eq`; core 8298)

This addendum adds `YangMills/RG/AppendixFHsharp.lean`, the definition-level
second Ursell layer after the second Appendix-F gas.

The fixed-size term `appendixFHoleHsharpTerm HF zK Y n` is the
`1/(n+1)!` Ursell monomial sum over tuples of second-gas polymers whose full
`omegaClusterUnion` is exactly the target `Y`.  The total object
`appendixFHoleHsharp HF zK Y` is the corresponding totalized `tsum` over
`n`, and `appendixFHoleHsharpOfKsharp` feeds in the evaluated `K#` activity
from `appendixFHoleSecondGasActivity`.

The finite theorem `appendixFHoleHsharpTerm_eq_sum_filter` rewrites the
`if`-guarded term as an explicit fiber sum.  The theorem
`appendixFHoleHsharpTerm_eq_zero_of_no_union` closes empty fibers.  The main
finite bookkeeping identity
`sum_appendixFHoleHsharpTerm_eq_clusterSum_term` proves that summing a fixed
cluster-size term over every target `Y` recovers exactly the matching
fixed-size term in the ordinary KP `clusterSum` for the second gas.

`YangMills.RG.singleScaleUVDecay_of_omegaRootedAppendixFHsharp`,
`YangMills.RG.singleScaleUVDecay_of_omegaRootedAppendixFHsharp_four_mul_margin`;
core 8299)

This addendum adds `YangMills/RG/AppendixFHsharpResidual.lean`, the bridge from
a source-supplied residual estimate on the complex second-Ursell object `H#`
to the existing real scalar UV-decay consumer.

The theorem
`clusterWithHolesActivityDecay_of_norm_appendixFHoleHsharp_le` states that if
`‖appendixFHoleHsharp HF (zK t k) Y‖` satisfies the residual bound with rate
`κ - 3κ₀ - 3`, then any real extraction `toReal` with
`|toReal w| <= ‖w‖` satisfies the real-valued
`ClusterWithHolesActivityDecay` predicate.  The rooted variant matches the
index type used by the omega-rooted modified-metric summability theorem.

The theorem `singleScaleUVDecay_of_omegaRootedAppendixFHsharp` composes that
real extraction with
`singleScaleUVDecay_of_omegaRootedClusterWithHolesActivities`, obtaining
`SingleScaleUVDecay` for scalar remainders of the form
`Rsc t k = ∑' P, toReal (appendixFHoleHsharp HF (zK t k) P)`, under the explicit
residual domination condition `κ₀ <= κ - 3κ₀ - 3`.  The theorem
`singleScaleUVDecay_of_omegaRootedAppendixFHsharp_four_mul_margin` supplies the
source-facing sufficient margin `κ >= 4κ₀ + 3`.

This addendum extends `YangMills/RG/AppendixFHsharpResidual.lean` with concrete
scalar projections for the residual `H#` adapter.

The theorems `complex_re_contracts_norm` and `complex_im_contracts_norm`
record the elementary contractions `|Complex.re w| <= ‖w‖` and
`|Complex.im w| <= ‖w‖`.  The real-part specializations
`singleScaleUVDecay_of_omegaRootedAppendixFHsharp_re` and
`singleScaleUVDecay_of_omegaRootedAppendixFHsharp_re_four_mul_margin` now feed
`Rsc t k = ∑' P, Complex.re (appendixFHoleHsharp HF (zK t k) P)` directly into
the scalar `SingleScaleUVDecay` consumer.  The corresponding imaginary-part
specializations are also available for auditing complex remainders.

core 8300)

This addendum adds `YangMills/RG/AppendixFHsharpPartial.lean`, the finite
cutoff version of the Appendix-F second Ursell layer.

The definition `appendixFHoleHsharpPartial HF zK N Y` is the finite sum of
`appendixFHoleHsharpTerm HF zK Y n` over `n < N`.  The lemmas
`appendixFHoleHsharpPartial_zero` and `appendixFHoleHsharpPartial_succ`
record the cutoff recursion.  The theorem
`sum_appendixFHoleHsharpPartial_eq_sum_clusterSum_terms` proves the finite
target-lumping identity: summing this partial `H#` over all target unions is
exactly the finite sum of the matching fixed-size ordinary KP cluster-sum
terms.

The residual-adapter half mirrors the totalized `H#` bridge.  A source-supplied
complex-norm estimate on the finite partial object feeds
`ClusterWithHolesActivityDecay`, then the omega-rooted
`SingleScaleUVDecay` producer, with the usual explicit residual domination
`κ₀ <= κ - 3κ₀ - 3` or sufficient margin `κ >= 4κ₀ + 3`.  Real-part
specializations are provided for the canonical scalar projection.

This addendum adds `YangMills/RG/AppendixFHsharpConvergence.lean`, the
contract layer between finite `H#` truncations and the totalized second Ursell
activity.

The theorem `appendixFHoleHsharpPartial_tendsto` proves that, for a fixed
target `Y`, summability of
`n ↦ appendixFHoleHsharpTerm HF zK Y n` implies convergence of the finite
partial activities to `appendixFHoleHsharp HF zK Y`.  The theorem
`norm_appendixFHoleHsharp_le_of_partial_bound` then passes any residual
complex-norm estimate uniform in the finite cutoff `N` to the totalized `H#`
by `le_of_tendsto'`.

The remaining theorems package that limit passage into the existing residual
adapters: totalized `ClusterWithHolesActivityDecay`, the rooted version, the
omega-rooted `SingleScaleUVDecay` producer, the sufficient source margin
`κ >= 4κ₀ + 3`, and the real-part specialization.

This addendum extends `YangMills/RG/AppendixFHsharpConvergence.lean` with the
tail/Cauchy form of the finite-to-total `H#` interface.

The theorem `appendixFHoleHsharp_eq_partial_add_tail` proves the exact
decomposition

```
appendixFHoleHsharp HF zK Y
  = appendixFHoleHsharpPartial HF zK N Y
    + ∑' i, appendixFHoleHsharpTerm HF zK Y (i + N).
```

The theorem `appendixFHoleHsharp_sub_partial_tendsto_zero` records that the
finite truncation error tends to zero under the fixed-target summability
hypothesis.  The quantitative theorem
`norm_appendixFHoleHsharp_sub_partial_le_tail_norm_tsum` bounds the truncation
error by the shifted norm-tail sum, and
`norm_appendixFHoleHsharp_sub_partial_le_of_tail_norm_bound` packages the same
statement when the source analysis has already supplied an explicit scalar
tail bound.

exact tail object and the norm inequality that future KP/Ursell estimates must

core 8302)

This addendum adds `YangMills/RG/AppendixFHsharpLimit.lean`, the pointwise
limit-transfer API for finite second-Ursell `H#` truncations.

The theorem `tendsto_appendixFHoleHsharpPartial_of_summable` records the
fixed-target convergence consequence of an explicit
`Summable (fun n => appendixFHoleHsharpTerm HF zK Y n)` hypothesis.  The
theorem `norm_appendixFHoleHsharp_le_residual_of_partial_limit` keeps the
analytic convergence premise even more explicit: if the finite partials
converge pointwise to the repository's totalized `appendixFHoleHsharp`, and if
the finite partials satisfy a residual norm estimate uniformly in the cutoff,
then the same residual estimate holds for total `H#`.  The proof is the
minimal order-theoretic limit transfer by `le_of_tendsto'`.

The summability version
`norm_appendixFHoleHsharp_le_residual_of_summable_terms` feeds the fixed-target
summability theorem into that pointwise limit transfer.  The UV theorem
`singleScaleUVDecay_of_omegaRootedAppendixFHsharp_re_four_mul_margin_of_partial_limit`
then applies the existing total `H#` real-part residual consumer after the
pointwise bound is obtained.  No limit is passed through the outer rooted
polymer `tsum`, so the future dominated-convergence/majorant obligation remains
localized to the second-Ursell source proof.

core 8303)

This addendum adds `YangMills/RG/AppendixFHsharpMajorant.lean`, the explicit
termwise-majorant contract for the second-Ursell `H#` layer.

The theorem `summable_appendixFHoleHsharpTerm_of_norm_le_majorant` proves that
a summable real majorant of
`‖appendixFHoleHsharpTerm HF zK Y n‖` gives fixed-target summability of the
complex `H#` term sequence.  The theorem
`norm_appendixFHoleHsharpPartial_le_majorant_sum` bounds finite `H#` partials
by the corresponding finite majorant sums.  The theorems
`appendixFHoleHsharp_tail_norm_tsum_le_majorant_tail` and
`norm_appendixFHoleHsharp_sub_partial_le_majorant_tail` package the shifted-tail
obligation: the truncation error is bounded by the shifted tail of the same
majorant.

The theorem `norm_appendixFHoleHsharp_le_residual_of_term_majorant` is the
source-facing bridge: if the termwise majorant is summable and its finite sums
obey the residual profile, then the totalized `appendixFHoleHsharp` satisfies
the pointwise residual estimate.  The real-part theorem
`singleScaleUVDecay_of_omegaRootedAppendixFHsharp_re_four_mul_margin_of_term_majorant`
feeds that contract into the existing omega-rooted UV consumer.

**Honest scope.** This module does not prove the analytic second-Ursell
majorant.  It only identifies the exact Lean shape a source proof must supply
to discharge fixed-target summability, finite-partial residual bounds, and
tail estimates.  The source `H#` estimate (Dimock II Theorem F.1/(636)), the

core 8304)

This addendum adds `YangMills/RG/AppendixFHsharpGeometricMajorant.lean`, the
closed-form geometric specialization of the termwise `H#` majorant interface.

The preliminary theorem `sum_range_le_tsum_of_nonneg` records the elementary
order fact that finite partial sums of a nonnegative summable real sequence are
bounded by the total `tsum`.  The theorems `summable_geometric_majorant` and
`tsum_geometric_majorant` package Mathlib's geometric series for the profile
`A * q^n` under `0 <= q < 1`, while
`sum_range_geometric_majorant_le_closed` bounds every finite partial sum by
`A * (1 - q)⁻¹` when `0 <= A`.  The theorem
`tsum_geometric_majorant_tail` gives the shifted-tail identity
`∑' i, A*q^(i+N) = A*q^N*(1-q)⁻¹`.

The `H#` theorem `norm_appendixFHoleHsharp_sub_partial_le_geometric_tail`
turns a termwise bound
`‖appendixFHoleHsharpTerm ... n‖ <= A*q^n` into the closed shifted-tail error
bound.  The theorem
`norm_appendixFHoleHsharp_le_residual_of_geometric_term_majorant` says that if
the closed total `A*(1-q)⁻¹` is below the residual profile, then total
`appendixFHoleHsharp` satisfies the pointwise residual estimate.  The real-part
omega-rooted theorem then feeds that geometric majorant contract into the
existing UV consumer under the sufficient margin `κ >= 4κ₀ + 3`.

**Honest scope.** This module does not prove that Dimock's second-Ursell/KP
analysis supplies an `A,q` geometric majorant.  It only discharges the
geometric-series bookkeeping once such a majorant has been proved externally or
in a later source-facing module.  The source `H#` estimate (Dimock II Theorem
F.1/(636)), the preceding `K/K#` estimate (642), concrete Yang-Mills raw

core 8305)

This addendum adds `YangMills/RG/AppendixFHsharpProfile.lean`, a
source-facing record for the closed-form geometric `H#` majorant contract.

The new structure `AppendixFHsharpGeometricMajorantProfile` packages the data a
future second-Ursell/KP source proof should provide: amplitudes `A`, ratios
`q`, the hypotheses `0 <= A`, `0 <= q < 1`, the termwise estimate
`‖appendixFHoleHsharpTerm ... n‖ <= A*q^n`, and the comparison of the closed
total `A*(1-q)⁻¹` with the residual profile.  The profile theorems expose the
already-verified consequences from one object: fixed-target summability,
closed shifted-tail control for finite truncations, the total pointwise
residual bound, and the omega-rooted real-part `SingleScaleUVDecay` consumer
under the sufficient margin `κ >= 4κ₀ + 3`.

refreshing that dependency and then rebuilding the root target fixed the cache
state.  The first oracle attempt timed out at 304s with no Lean error; after
the root target was refreshed, the long oracle run completed and the new
entries report only `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

**Honest scope.** This is a packaging layer only.  It does not prove the
geometric majorant, the second-Ursell/KP estimate, Dimock II Theorem F.1/(636),
Dimock (642), concrete Yang-Mills raw activity decay, continuum construction,

core 8305)

This addendum strengthens `YangMills/RG/AppendixFHsharpMajorant.lean` at the
exact finite interface between the Appendix-F `H#` target fibers and the
already-formalized sharp KP cluster-weight theorem.

The theorem `norm_appendixFHoleHsharpTerm_le_clusterWeight` proves that a
fixed-target exact-union term
`appendixFHoleHsharpTerm HF zK Y n` is bounded by the global absolute
per-size cluster weight `KP.clusterWeight (omegaHolePolymerSystem HF zK) n`.
Consequently, `summable_appendixFHoleHsharpTerm_of_KPCriterion` combines that
finite fiber bound with `KP.kp_clusterWeight_summable_sharp` to obtain
fixed-target summability directly from `KP.KPCriterion`.

The new size-majorant residual consumers accept a target-sensitive scalar
majorant `M t k P n` whose total `tsum` is already bounded by the desired
residual profile.  They then produce finite-partial residual bounds, total
pointwise `H#` residual bounds, and the omega-rooted real-part
`SingleScaleUVDecay` consumer under the sufficient margin
`κ >= 4κ₀ + 3`.

**Honest scope.** The KP consequence is fixed-target summability only: the
global `clusterWeight` has forgotten the target `Y`, so it does not prove the
target-sensitive residual profile needed for Dimock F.1/(636).  The
size-majorant theorems are consumers for a future source proof of that
target-sensitive bound, not the proof itself.  Dimock (642), concrete
Yang-Mills raw activity decay, continuum construction, and Clay remain open.

core 8306)

This addendum adds `YangMills/RG/AppendixFHsharpSourceMajorant.lean`, the
source-facing absolute finite-sum bridge for the Appendix-F second-Ursell
`H#` layer.

The definition `appendixFHoleHsharpAbsTerm` is the nonnegative fixed-union
counterpart of `appendixFHoleHsharpTerm`: it keeps the same finite
`1/(n+1)!` Ursell fiber over tuples whose `omegaClusterUnion` is the target
`Y`, but replaces the complex summand by
`|ursell(X)| * prod_i ‖activity(X_i)‖`.  The theorem
`norm_appendixFHoleHsharpTerm_le_absTerm` is pure finite triangle inequality.

The structure `AppendixFHsharpSourceMajorant` packages the exact geometric
contract expected from a later source proof: amplitudes `A`, ratios `q`,
positivity, `q < 1`, a termwise bound
`‖appendixFHoleHsharpTerm ... n‖ <= A*q^n`, and the closed residual comparison.
The constructor `appendixFHsharpSourceMajorant_of_absTerm_geometric` turns an
estimate on the absolute finite term into that contract.  The constructor
`appendixFHsharpSourceMajorant_of_factorized_absTerm_geometric` records the
preferred source shape, with target geometry isolated as
`exp(-r * (d_M(P)+1))` and order decay as `rho(t,k)^n`.  The namespace theorems
`AppendixFHsharpSourceMajorant.summable_terms`,
`AppendixFHsharpSourceMajorant.tail_bound`, and
`AppendixFHsharpSourceMajorant.residual_bound` expose fixed-target summability,
closed shifted-tail control, and the pointwise residual estimate from the
packaged source object.  The final two global theorems feed the same contract
into the existing total residual and omega-rooted real-part `SingleScaleUVDecay`
consumers.

`YangMills.RG.appendixFHoleKsharp_support_subset`; core 8306)

This addendum strengthens `YangMills/RG/AppendixFKsharp.lean`, the finite
`K(Y) -> K#(Y)` object layer.

The two new local-activity theorems prove the finite support bridge that had
previously been an explicit obligation around the Appendix-F factorization
layer: if each raw local activity indexed by `X ∈ Λ` has spectator support
contained in the full source polymer `X.val`, then the connected first
activity over a target union `Y` has spectator support contained in `Y`; and
the analogous statement holds for fluctuation support.  The proof uses only
the target-fiber equality
`appendixFCoverUnion (fun X => X.val) C = Y` and the finite fact that every
index contributing to that fiber lies in `Λ`.

The third theorem transfers the spectator-support statement through
`appendixFHoleKsharp`: after integrating the fluctuation field, the resulting
spectator `LocalFunctional` has support contained in the same target union
`Y`.

This addendum adds `YangMills/RG/AppendixFSecondUrsellSource.lean`, the first
source-independent coefficientwise tree step for the Appendix-F second-Ursell
`H#` layer.

The definition `appendixFHoleHsharpTreeTerm` has exactly the same target fiber
and factorial normalization as `appendixFHoleHsharpAbsTerm`, but replaces the
absolute Ursell coefficient by the finite sum over spanning trees of the tuple
incompatibility graph.  The theorem
`appendixFHoleHsharpAbsTerm_le_treeTerm` is a direct finite application of the
already-verified Penrose tree-graph inequality
`KP.abs_ursell_le_card_spanningTrees`, followed by multiplication by the
nonnegative product of activity norms and summation over the fixed-union fiber.

This addendum strengthens the finite `K -> K#` layer before the source
second-Ursell estimates.

`YangMills/RG/UltralocalFactorization.lean` now has n-ary product-measure
factorization theorems for finite products of `LocalFunctional`s with
pairwise-disjoint supports and finite products of `LocalActivity`s with
pairwise-disjoint fluctuation supports.  These are finite products over an
explicit ultralocal probability measure, not Gaussian covariance estimates.

`YangMills/RG/AppendixFKsharp.lean` now derives active-skeleton support
containment for first connected target activities from source-local
one-polymer support containment.  It then proves two finite admissible-family
factorization adapters:

* a fluctuation-field factorization turning a finite admissible product of
  connected target activities into the product of their integrated `K#(Y)`
  values, when each raw one-polymer fluctuation support lies inside its active
  skeleton;
* a spectator-field factorization for finite products of `K#(Y)` over
  admissible target families, when each raw one-polymer spectator support lies
  inside its active skeleton.

This addendum closes the finite target-family sum layer on top of Addendum
214's product factorization.

`YangMills/RG/AppendixFKsharp.lean` now proves that the finite sum over
admissible source-facing target families commutes with the first fluctuation
integration and then factors termwise into the corresponding finite `K#`
target-family gas, assuming only per-target-family integrability and the
source-local active-skeleton fluctuation-support bridge.

It also proves the spectator-side finite target-family identity: integrating
the finite `K#` target-family gas under an ultralocal spectator product
measure equals the sum over admissible target families of products of the
single-target spectator integrals, again with per-summand integrability kept
explicit.  This is the finite algebraic/measure-theoretic substrate behind
Dimock (643)--(644), not a quantitative activity estimate.

integrating the local `K#(Y, psi)` functional over the spectator product
measure.  It packages this scalar activity as
`appendixFHoleIntegratedSecondGas`, proves that it vanishes outside the first
connected-cover target region, and rewrites the spectator integral of the
finite `K#` target-family gas as a finite admissible-family sum using this
scalar `z_K` activity.

`YangMills/RG/AppendixFHsharp.lean` now exposes

as `appendixFHoleIntegratedKsharpActivityFamily`.  It then specializes both
source-majorant constructors to this concrete `zK` family: one constructor
from an arbitrary absolute fixed-union geometric estimate, and one from the
preferred factorized form with a modified-metric exponential and a
target-independent cluster-order ratio.

The same module also rewrites the pointwise residual consumer and the
real-part omega-rooted UV consumer for the named object
`appendixFHoleHsharpOfIntegratedKsharp`.  The source proof still must supply
the termwise absolute/tree estimate, positivity, ratio bound, and closed

second-Ursell leaf estimate.

`YangMills/RG/AppendixFSecondUrsellWeightedTree.lean` defines a weighted
fixed-union tree term with the same target fiber and factorial normalization
as `appendixFHoleHsharpTreeTerm`, replacing each activity norm by a supplied
weight `w`.

The main theorem is finite algebra:

```
appendixFHoleHsharpTreeTerm HF zK Y n <=
  epsilon^(n+1) *
    appendixFHoleHsharpWeightedTreeTerm HF zK w Y n
```

under the explicit pointwise hypothesis
`||zK Q.val|| <= epsilon * w Q`.  The exponent is `n+1`, matching the
repository convention that term index `n` uses tuples of size `n + 1`.

The same module now also packages the exact finite reassociation needed by
the source-facing factorized tree constructors:

```
epsilon^(n+1) * (Croot * decay * Cleaf^n)
  =
(Croot * epsilon * decay) * (Cleaf * epsilon)^n.
```

Thus a source theorem may target the weighted tree estimate
`Croot * residualDecay(P) * Cleaf^n`; the Lean side turns it into the
preferred root/leaf factorization under the first-activity size bound.

estimate, Dimock's leaf summation, the Ksharp source decay, Dimock F.1/(636),
Dimock (642), concrete Yang-Mills raw activity decay, continuum construction,
or Clay.  It only extracts the scalar activity-size factor from the finite
tree term so that the remaining geometric/source estimate has a sharper
Lean-facing target.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

core 8315)

This addendum specializes Addendum 219's weighted finite tree transfer to the
CMP116 integrated `K#` family.

`YangMills/RG/BalabanCMP116HsharpSource.lean` now imports the weighted tree
transfer and exposes three source-facing constructors.  The source theorem may
now supply:

```
appendixFHoleHsharpWeightedTreeTerm HF zK w P.val n <=
  Croot(t,k) *
    exp (-(residualRate * (d_M(P)+1))) *
  Cleaf(t,k)^n
```

together with the pointwise first-activity estimate
`||zK Q.val|| <= epsilon(t,k) * w Q`, nonnegativity of the weights and
constants, `Cleaf(t,k) * epsilon(t,k) < 1`, and the closed comparison

```
(Croot(t,k) * epsilon(t,k)) *
  (1 - Cleaf(t,k) * epsilon(t,k))^-1
<= C * H0 * exp (-c0*t) * g(k)^kappa0.
```

The Lean side turns those hypotheses into the existing CMP116 geometric
profile, the closed `cluster3` contract, or the one-shot omega-rooted UV
consumer.  No analytic leaf estimate is proved; it remains the external
CMP116/Dimock source obligation.

## Addendum 221 (2026-06-21, **CMP116 weighted Hsharp source map**;
documentation only)

This addendum adds `docs/CMP116-WEIGHTED-HSHARP-SOURCE-MAP.md` and updates the
live state to record the current source boundary for the CMP116 weighted
`H#` bridge.

The source map distinguishes three facts that should not be collapsed:

* CMP116, especially (2.4)-(2.11) and Lemma 3/(2.38), is a source-backed
  candidate for the first localized activity estimate after constants,
  supports, and metrics are translated;
* Dimock I Appendix B Step 4 is the printed no-hole mechanism for the
  tree/Ursell leaf summation;
* Dimock II Appendix F theorem `cluster3` is the hole-aware final theorem, but
  it does not print the repository's exact order-wise weighted tree term.

The immediate fork is therefore explicit: either formalize the with-holes
order-wise leaf summation, or expose a direct consumer for Dimock II `cluster3`.
CMP116 alone should not be used as if it proved the weighted `H#` tree
hypothesis.

All completed green.  Since this commit changes documentation only, no new Lean
theorem or oracle entry is introduced.

**Honest scope.** This is provenance/control-plane documentation only.  It does
not prove the first-activity estimate, the weighted tree estimate, the closed
smallness comparison, Dimock's leaf summation, Dimock (642), concrete
Yang-Mills raw activity decay, continuum construction, or Clay.  Clay distance

## Addendum 222 (2026-06-21, **rooted child-order assignments for marked
Hsharp trees**; core 8320)

This addendum strengthens the finite Appendix-F Route-B spine around
`YangMills/RG/AppendixFSecondUrsellMarkedFugacity.lean`.

`YangMills/KP/RootedChildCount.lean` now names the finite type
`rootedChildOrderAssignments T`: an independent permutation of each rooted BFS
child fiber of a tree edge set `T`.  The theorem
`card_rootedChildOrderAssignments` proves that its cardinality is exactly

```
prod_v (rootedChildCount T v)!
```

the factorial product previously used abstractly in the marked-root
second-Ursell majorant.

`AppendixFSecondUrsellMarkedFugacity.lean` now exposes the corresponding
root-marked sum
`appendixFHoleHsharpWeightedTreeMarkedRootChildOrderSum`, proves it is equal
to the earlier factorial-product form
`appendixFHoleHsharpWeightedTreeMarkedRootChildFactorSum`, and gives the
direct priced consumer
`appendixFHoleHsharpWeightedTreeMarkedRootChildOrderSum_le_inv_succ_mul_rawSum`.
This turns the child-factorial loss into an actual finite assignment object
that a future leaf-summation map can target.

## Addendum 223 (2026-06-22, **CMP116 clipped-active-region support constructors**; core 8328)

This addendum adds two finite support constructors for the CMP116 Appendix-F
source package in `YangMills/RG/BalabanCMP116KsharpAdapter.lean`.

`BalabanCMP116AppendixFSupportHypotheses.of_activeSupport_subset_target_inter_omegaRegion`
turns the source-facing inclusion
`F.activeSupport X ⊆ X.val ∩ F.Omega`, together with
`F.Omega = HF.omegaRegion`, into the existing skeleton-locality package.
`BalabanCMP116AppendixFSupportHypotheses.of_activeSupport_eq_target_inter_omegaRegion`
is the equality-form convenience constructor.

Both use the already-proved finite identity
`skeleton HF X.val = X.val ∩ HF.omegaRegion`; they introduce no new analytic
or physical assumption.

preservation, `hRpoly`, continuum construction, OS/Wightman reconstruction, or
Clay.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 224 (2026-06-22, **CMP116 hard-core graph to Appendix-F skeleton graph**; core 8328)

This addendum extends the CMP116 clipped-active-region adapter in
`YangMills/RG/BalabanCMP116KsharpAdapter.lean`.

Assuming the source-facing equalities `F.Omega = HF.omegaRegion` and
`F.activeSupport X = X.val ∩ F.Omega` on the polymers in `Λ`,
`BalabanCMP116AppendixFSupportHypotheses.zeta_eq_zero_iff_not_disjoint_skeleton_of_activeSupport_eq_target_inter_omegaRegion`
rewrites the CMP116 hard-core condition `F.zeta X Y = 0` as non-disjointness
of the two active skeletons.  The companion theorem
`BalabanCMP116AppendixFSupportHypotheses.omegaGraph_adj_iff_skeletonOverlapGraph_adj_of_activeSupport_eq_target_inter_omegaRegion`
identifies the CMP116 Ω-overlap graph with the Appendix-F skeleton-overlap
graph on those polymers.

## Addendum 225 (2026-06-22, **CMP116 one-way hard-core graph adapter from support inclusion**; core 8328)

This addendum adds the inclusion-form version of the CMP116 hard-core graph
adapter in `YangMills/RG/BalabanCMP116KsharpAdapter.lean`.

`BalabanCMP116AppendixFSupportHypotheses.zeta_eq_zero_imp_not_disjoint_skeleton_of_activeSupport_subset_target_inter_omegaRegion`
shows that, if `F.Omega = HF.omegaRegion` and
`F.activeSupport X ⊆ X.val ∩ F.Omega`, then a CMP116 hard-core overlap
`F.zeta X Y = 0` implies non-disjointness of the Appendix-F active skeletons.
The companion
`BalabanCMP116AppendixFSupportHypotheses.omegaGraph_adj_imp_skeletonOverlapGraph_adj_of_activeSupport_subset_target_inter_omegaRegion`
maps CMP116 Ω-overlap graph edges into Appendix-F skeleton-overlap graph edges
under the same inclusion hypotheses.

**Honest scope.** This is finite graph/support bookkeeping only.  It does not

domain, CMP116 localization, measurability, raw activity decay, `hR`,
large-field-hole preservation, `hRpoly`, continuum construction,
OS/Wightman reconstruction, or Clay.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 226 (2026-06-22, **CMP116 source-map audit for localized support**; docs only)

This addendum updates `docs/CMP116-WEIGHTED-HSHARP-SOURCE-MAP.md` and
`docs/SOURCE-CLAIM-AUDIT.md` after the support and hard-core graph adapters
through commit `9a160b67`.

The source map now records the latest Lean consumers:
`BalabanCMP116AppendixFSupportHypotheses.of_activeSupport_subset_target_inter_omegaRegion`,
`BalabanCMP116AppendixFSupportHypotheses.omegaGraph_adj_imp_skeletonOverlapGraph_adj_of_activeSupport_subset_target_inter_omegaRegion`,
and
`singleScaleUVDecay_of_omegaRootedBalabanCMP116AppendixFHsharp_re_four_mul_margin_of_rawMetricDecay_rooted_canonicalRoot_halfBudget_of_sourceMeasurable`.

The audit also records the local OCR verdict around CMP116 (2.5)--(2.11) and
Lemma 3/(2.38): the paper supports the product-Gaussian change of variables,
the localized activity `H(Z)`, component factorization, hard-core `zeta`, and
the Lemma 3 decay estimate, but the printed statement that `H(Z)` is localized
in the interior of `Z` is not yet the exact Lean support theorem
`F.activeSupport X subset X.val inter F.Omega` or
`F.activeSupport X subset skeleton HF X.val`.  The remaining source packet must
identify the enlargement convention, hole/large-field compatibility, and the
map from Balaban's localization domains to `OmegaPolymerType` support fields.

**Honest scope.** This is documentation/audit work only.  It corrects the live

localization, measurability, raw activity decay, `hR`, large-field-hole
preservation, `hRpoly`, continuum construction, OS/Wightman reconstruction, or
Clay.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 227 (2026-06-22, **current state checkpoint refresh**; docs only)

This addendum updates `CURRENT-STATE.md` after the public checkpoint
`a9d1ebb2d649f9c96819474d1241f8da562e9b4a`.

The top-level certified checkpoint and core job count now match the latest
verified public main: `lake build YangMillsCore` is green at 8328 jobs.  The
RG substrate summary also records the current source-facing CMP116 endpoint
`singleScaleUVDecay_of_omegaRootedBalabanCMP116AppendixFHsharp_re_four_mul_margin_of_rawMetricDecay_rooted_canonicalRoot_halfBudget_of_sourceMeasurable`
and repeats the precise source boundary: CMP116 (2.5)--(2.11) and Lemma
3/(2.38) support the product-Gaussian change, localized `H(Z)`, hard-core
`zeta`, and decay estimate, but not yet the exact Lean active-support theorem.

Clay.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 228 (2026-06-22, **CMP116 graph adapter from support package**; core 8328)

This addendum adds the support-package form of the CMP116 one-way hard-core
graph adapter in `YangMills/RG/BalabanCMP116KsharpAdapter.lean`.

The theorem
`BalabanCMP116AppendixFSupportHypotheses.zeta_eq_zero_imp_not_disjoint_skeleton_of_supportHypotheses`
shows that, once the source has supplied the single support package
`F.activeSupport X subset skeleton HF X.val`, a CMP116 hard-core overlap
`F.zeta X Y = 0` implies non-disjointness of the Appendix-F active skeletons.
The companion theorem
`BalabanCMP116AppendixFSupportHypotheses.omegaGraph_adj_imp_skeletonOverlapGraph_adj_of_supportHypotheses`
maps CMP116 Ω-overlap graph edges into Appendix-F skeleton-overlap graph edges
using only that support package.

This sharpens the previous inclusion-form graph adapter: a source theorem may
now target active-skeleton locality directly, without separately restating
`F.Omega = HF.omegaRegion` and the clipped-region inclusion for the one-way
graph step.

Verification:

activity decay, `hR`, large-field-hole preservation, `hRpoly`, continuum
construction, OS/Wightman reconstruction, or Clay.  Clay distance **~0%
(<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 229 (2026-06-22, **CMP116 no-cross-edge adapter from support package**; core 8328)

This addendum adds the factorization-facing no-cross-edge direction for the
CMP116 support package in `YangMills/RG/BalabanCMP116KsharpAdapter.lean`.

The theorem
`BalabanCMP116AppendixFSupportHypotheses.zeta_eq_one_of_disjoint_skeleton_of_supportHypotheses`
shows that if two Appendix-F active skeletons are disjoint and the source
active supports are contained in those skeletons, then the CMP116 hard-core
factor is inactive: `F.zeta X Y = 1`.  The companion theorem
`BalabanCMP116AppendixFSupportHypotheses.not_omegaGraph_adj_of_disjoint_skeleton_of_supportHypotheses`
packages this as absence of a CMP116 Ω-overlap graph edge.

This is the no-cross-edge companion to Addendum 228: Addendum 228 maps CMP116
edges into skeleton edges, while this addendum lets skeleton-disjointness rule
out CMP116 edges.  Both remain conditional on the same source support package.

Clay.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 230 (2026-06-22, **current state source-frontier refresh**; docs only)

This addendum updates the live source-frontier documentation after public
checkpoint `9c2f42c0fc482d51223915b2eacda142dfef97c8`.

`CURRENT-STATE.md` now names `9c2f42c0fc482d51223915b2eacda142dfef97c8` as
the last certified public checkpoint and records the current finite CMP116
hard-core dictionary: under the single source support package
`F.activeSupport X subset skeleton HF X.val`, CMP116 Ω-overlap edges map to
Appendix-F skeleton-overlap edges, and skeleton-disjoint source polymers have
`F.zeta X Y = 1` with no CMP116 Ω-overlap edge.

`docs/CMP116-WEIGHTED-HSHARP-SOURCE-MAP.md` and
`docs/SOURCE-CLAIM-AUDIT.md` now point their live interface notes at
`9c2f42c` rather than older checkpoints.  The refresh also keeps the boundary
explicit: these graph facts are finite consequences of the support package and
do not prove the CMP116 localization theorem that should instantiate the
package.

## Addendum 231 (2026-06-22, **checkpoint header correction**; docs only)

This addendum corrects a small stale-checkpoint mismatch left after Addendum
230.

`CURRENT-STATE.md` now names
`a901214da57491603d86756a35768d727ebe012e` as the last certified public

This addendum gives the spectator-integrated scalar second gas the same
KP-ready interface already available for the evaluated second gas.

`YangMills/RG/AppendixFSecondGas.lean` now defines
`AppendixFHoleIntegratedSecondGasKPMajorant`, the tilted pointwise majorant
for `appendixFHoleIntegratedSecondGas`, and proves
`appendixFHoleIntegratedSecondGas_KPCriterion_of_majorant` by feeding that
majorant into
`omegaHolePolymerSystem_KPCriterion_volumeUniform_skeleton_exp_of_metric_bound`.

`YangMills/RG/BalabanCMP116SecondGasAdapter.lean` exposes the CMP116
specialization
`BalabanCMP116AppendixFIntegratedSecondGasKPMajorant` and
`balabanCMP116AppendixFIntegratedSecondGas_KPCriterion_of_majorant`, so the
scalar `z_K` carrier produced after spectator integration can be handed
directly to the with-holes KP criterion once a source majorant is supplied.

**Honest scope.** This is a finite consumer adapter only.  It does not prove

This addendum separates the remaining integrated scalar KP-majorant obligation
into a finite norm-bound transfer and a scalar profile inequality.

`YangMills/RG/AppendixFSecondGas.lean` now proves
`appendixFHoleIntegratedSecondGasKPMajorant_of_norm_bound`: any pointwise norm
bound `B(Y)` for the spectator-integrated scalar second gas gives the KP-ready
majorant as soon as `B` satisfies the already-tilted profile

```
exp t * B(Y) * exp |Y| <= A * q^(d_M(Y)+1).
```

`YangMills/RG/BalabanCMP116SecondGasAdapter.lean` then proves
`BalabanCMP116AppendixFIntegratedSecondGasKPMajorant_of_rawMetricDecay_rooted_of_source`.
It uses the existing source-measurable rooted raw-metric `K#` estimate inside
the first connected target region and the zero-extension theorem outside that
region.  The theorem leaves exactly the final scalar profile comparison as an
explicit hypothesis; no cardinality/constant conversion is hidden.

This addendum splits the scalar `A,q` profile left by Addendum 233 into a
finite exponential-calculus lemma and a source-facing CMP116 consumer.

`YangMills/RG/AppendixFLocalSummability.lean` now proves
`appendixFHoleExpWeight_tilted_profile_le_of_card_le_metric`: if the full
cardinality of a target satisfies

```
|X| <= theta * (d_M(X)+1),
```

then the KP tilt `exp t * exp |X|` can be absorbed into the shifted
modified-metric weight by choosing

```
q = exp (-(rate - theta))
```

and assuming the scalar amplitude comparison `exp t * C <= A`.

`YangMills/RG/BalabanCMP116SecondGasAdapter.lean` now applies this finite lemma
to the spectator-integrated CMP116 second gas.  The majorant wrapper
`BalabanCMP116AppendixFIntegratedSecondGasKPMajorant_of_rawMetricDecay_rooted_of_source_of_card_le_metric`
and the direct KP consumer
`balabanCMP116AppendixFIntegratedSecondGas_KPCriterion_of_rawMetricDecay_rooted_of_source_of_card_le_metric`

`YangMills.RG.appendixFCoverUnion_card_real_le_sum`,

`YangMills.RG.appendixFHoleTargetFiber_card_le_metricSum_of_source_card_le_metric`;
core 8328)

This addendum records the finite cardinality part left exposed by Addendum
234, without claiming the still-missing direct target-metric budget.

`YangMills/RG/AppendixFFiniteCover.lean` now proves the generic overlap-safe
union bound

```
|(appendixFCoverUnion support C)| <= sum_{i in C} |support i|,
```

together with a real-valued cast form for quantitative consumers.

`YangMills/RG/AppendixFQuantitative.lean` specializes this to active
with-holes Appendix-F covers.  If every source polymer in a selected finite
cover obeys

```
|X| <= theta * (d_M(X)+1),
```

then the represented full target satisfies the cover-sum estimate

```
|Y| <= theta * sum_{X in C} (d_M(X)+1).
```

The target-fiber theorem uses only the exact equation
`appendixFCoverUnion (fun X => X.val) C = Y`.

**Honest scope.** This does not prove the full KP-profile hypothesis
`|Y| <= theta * (d_M(Y)+1)`.  The new theorem gives only the weaker and
source-faithful cover-sum budget; closing the direct target-metric compression
or reformulating the second-gas KP constants remains a source/geometric
obligation.  It also does not prove Dimock (642), CMP116 localization, raw
activity decay, spectator-field law, `hR`, `hRpoly`, continuum construction,
OS/Wightman reconstruction, or Clay.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%),
unchanged**.

`YangMills.RG.schurCatalanBudget`,

`YangMills.RG.schurCatalan_lower_bound_of_finset_budget`,
`YangMills.RG.schurCatalan_coercive_of_finset_budget`;
core 8329)

This addendum records the scalar positivity bookkeeping highlighted by the
P4/Riemann comparison note, without turning it into a physical source claim.

`YangMills/RG/SchurCatalanBudget.lean` introduces the scalar envelope

```
(1 - sqrt (1 - 4 * M^2 * epsilon)) / (2 * M)
```

as `schurCatalanBudget`, and proves the finite coercivity principle:
if a base quadratic form dominates `cBase * q v` and each selected finite
multiscale defect is bounded by its scalar budget times `q v`, then the base
minus defects dominates the remaining budget.  In particular,
`schurCatalan_coercive_of_finset_budget` proves strict positivity whenever

```
sum_i schurCatalanBudget (M i) (epsilon i) < cBase
```

and `0 < q v`.

```

**Honest scope.** This is a finite scalar closure theorem only.  It does not
prove that the Yang--Mills gauge-fixed Hessian is self-adjoint/coercive, does
not prove a Schur-complement self-energy expansion, does not prove propagator
localization, does not prove the R-operation gain, and does not construct or
bound the concrete raw gauge activity.  Those remain exactly the P4
source/geometric obligations.  It also does not prove or use RH.  Clay distance
**~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 237 (2026-06-22, **gauge precision coercivity bookkeeping**
`YangMills.RG.coercive_add_adjointMass_of_blockPoincare`,
`YangMills.RG.coercive_add_qMassCLM_of_blockPoincare`,
`YangMills.RG.coercive_add_perturbation`;
core 8330)

This addendum records the first source-independent P4 coercivity brick prompted
by the spectral/coercivity diagnosis.  The relevant P3 fixed-tree and
target-sensitive `H#` leaf-summation estimates were already present on current
`main`, so this checkpoint moves to the next safe algebraic layer rather than
duplicating the existing leaf-summation route.

`YangMills/RG/GaugePrecision.lean` proves that an explicit block
Poincare/Hodge estimate

```
||x||^2 <= C_P * (<x, K x> + ||Q x||^2)
```

together with positivity of the background quadratic form implies coercivity
of the precision operator

```
K + a * Q†Q
```

with constant

```
min(1,a) / C_P.
```

The theorem `coercive_add_qMassCLM_of_blockPoincare` specializes the abstract
statement to the existing scaled averaging mass `qMassCLM = Q†Q`; the
perturbative closure `coercive_add_perturbation` records the elementary
stability under a quadratic-form defect bounded below by `-delta * ||x||^2`.

**Honest scope.** This is Hilbert-space coercivity algebra only.  It does not
prove the Yang--Mills block Poincare/Hodge theorem, does not identify the
physical gauge-fixed Hessian as `K`, does not prove propagator/covariance
decay, does not construct the raw RG activity, and does not discharge `hRpoly`.
It is designed to be consumed by a future source-backed Hessian/coercivity
packet.  Clay distance **~0% (<0.1%), unchanged**.

`YangMills.RG.isCoerciveCLM_qMassCLM_zero`,
`YangMills.RG.isCoerciveCLM_add_qMassCLM_of_blockPoincare`;
core 8331)

This addendum records the next source-independent P4 coercivity brick from the
gauge-raw-activity handoff.  Appendix F/H# already has the source-facing
consumer from `hraw`/integrability/`hR` to `SingleScaleUVDecay`; this checkpoint
therefore stays before Appendix F and formalizes only the operator-budget
inequality needed by a future gauge-fixed precision proof.

`YangMills/RG/CoercivePerturbation.lean` introduces the predicate

```
IsCoerciveCLM A c := forall x, c * ||x||^2 <= <x, A x>
```

for continuous linear maps on a real Hilbert space.  The key estimate
`abs_inner_apply_le_opNorm_mul_norm_sq` proves

```
|<x, B x>| <= ||B|| * ||x||^2,
```

and the additive/subtractive perturbation theorems show that a perturbation
with operator norm at most `delta` reduces the coercivity constant by at most
`delta`.  The summable-family theorem
`isCoercive_sub_tsum_of_norm_budget` proves the corresponding result for
`A - sum' i, Sigma i` from a scalar summable budget
`||Sigma i|| <= delta i`.

The qMass sanity hooks repackage the existing adjoint block-average mass:
`qMassCLM` is coercive with semidefinite constant `0`, and the previous
block-Poincare plus `qMassCLM` coercivity theorem is exposed through the new
`IsCoerciveCLM` predicate.

**Honest scope.** This is still deterministic Hilbert-space algebra only.  It
does not define the Yang--Mills gauge-fixed Hessian, prove the needed
Poincare/Hodge estimate, identify the covariance as an inverse, construct
`C^(1/2)`, localize the whitened fluctuation integrand, construct
`BalabanCMP116LocalizedActivityFamily`, prove `hraw`, prove measurability, or
establish the physical remainder identity `hR`.  Clay distance **~0%
(<0.1%), unchanged**.

## Addendum 239 (2026-06-22, **rooted leaf-summation half-budget wrapper**
`YangMills.RG.singleScaleUVDecay_of_omegaRootedBalabanCMP116AppendixFHsharp_re_four_mul_margin_of_rawMetricDecay_rooted_leafSummation_of_halfBudget`;
core 8331)

This addendum records a small Appendix-F/H# endpoint simplification requested
by the implementation memo.  The existing raw-metric rooted leaf-summation
endpoint required three separate second-Ursell obligations:

```
hsmall
hρ1
hBclosed
```

The new wrapper keeps the explicit rooted first-cover budget family `K₀` and
its proof `hroot`, but replaces those three obligations by the already-verified
uniform half-budget/profile hypotheses:

```
appendixFSecondUrsellLeafConstant d κ₀ * (2 * A₀ t k * K₀ t k) <= 1 / 2
4 * appendixFSecondUrsellMomentConstant d κ₀ * A₀ t k * K₀ t k <= profile
```

It then calls `appendixFSecondUrsell_sourceObligations_of_halfBudget` once and
projects the resulting conjunction into the existing leaf-summation endpoint.
The stronger canonical-root endpoints already on `main` continue to discharge
`hroot` too; this theorem is the intermediate API for non-canonical rooted
budgets.

Verification:

```
lake env lean YangMills\RG\AppendixFHsharpLeafSource.lean
lake build YangMillsCore
lake env lean oracle_check.lean
git diff --check

```

**Honest scope.** This is endpoint bookkeeping only.  It does not prove the
CMP116 raw activity estimate `hraw`, does not derive integrability/measurability
from the concrete activity, does not identify the physical remainder `hR`, and
does not construct the Yang--Mills gauge activity.  Clay distance **~0%
(<0.1%), unchanged**.
