# hRpoly CMP102 → CMP116 vertical slice

**Date:** 2026-07-28  
**Branch:** `codex/cmp116-interacting-wilson-hessian`  
**Baseline audited:** `d8856a76`

## Purpose

This document replaces job count by a consumer-facing progress metric.  A
checkpoint counts as progress toward the terminal CMP116 theorem only when it
constructs, or removes a hypothesis from, one of the objects consumed by

```lean
cmp116Eq226PhysicalContour_singleScaleUVDecay_boundedHoles_of_boundaries
```

The terminal boundary objects are:

1. a physical contour source family `S`;
2. `CMP116Lemma3Eq229ScaleBoundary`;
3. `CMP116Lemma3PStageSourceScaleBoundary`;
4. `CMP116Lemma3WeightedPostPSourceScaleBoundary`;
5. the scalar decay profile `hprofile`.

The fifth item contains the target time profile
`Real.exp (-(c0 * (t : ℝ)))`; it must therefore be generated from source
parameters rather than treated as a harmless bookkeeping premise.

## Import-graph audit

Before the bridge module introduced after `d8856a76`, no file whose basename
was outside the `BalabanCMP102*` family imported a `BalabanCMP102*` module.
The terminal theorem occurred only in its definition file and its audit file.
Consequently, the CMP102 producer lane compiled but did not feed the CMP116
consumer lane.

The first exact type bridge is now:

```lean
cmp102FineFieldEquivCMP116PhysicalGaugeField
```

in `BalabanCMP116CMP102PhysicalFieldBridge.lean`.  It identifies the plain
physical positive-bond field used by CMP116 with the `PiLp 2` realization
used by CMP102, proves coordinate equality, and proves both round trips.
This bridge discharges no analytic boundary by itself.

## `CMP116Eq226PhysicalContourTermSource` field audit

The source record is the first object that must be constructed physically.
Its current status against the CMP102 lane is:

| Record component | CMP102 producer status |
|---|---|
| `contour` | **missing seed globally**: every current constructor transforms an existing density; no lane constructs a closed initial `CMP116Eq214PhysicalContourDensity` |
| `source` | physical Gamma/operator ingredients exist, but no equality installs them in the contour density |
| `domainMetric`, `domainSupport` | domain geometry exists on the CMP102 side; no typed equality to the contour index family |
| Cauchy-radius identities | generic CMP116 formulas exist; not instantiated by a CMP102 contour producer |
| positivity/smallness scalars | many scalar lemmas exist; no complete source record |
| `outer_bound` | no CMP102-to-contour theorem |
| `inner_bound` | no CMP102-to-contour theorem |
| contour `potential` summand | **quadratic branch only**: the CMP102 domain radial operator is installed and proved equal termwise to the literal equation-(80) domain contribution; the independent residual `V''_k` is not constructed |
| `interaction_bound` | **open**: its terminal residual is `cmp116Eq220ResidualDomainWeight`, so it requires a concrete `V''_k` satisfying (1.36); closing the `Q_Y` branch through (1.43)/(2.19) does not discharge this field |
| `source_bound` | operator/source bounds exist parametrically; no installed contour source |
| `domain_nonempty`, `domain_subset` | geometric ingredients exist; no source-record construction |
| `rooted_residual` | **missing source instance** |
| `volume_budget` | **missing source instance** |

Therefore:

```text
physical CMP116Eq226PhysicalContourTermSource constructed: 0
terminal boundary objects discharged from CMP102:          0 / 5
terminal theorem instantiated nontrivially:                 0
```

## Closed CMP102 result retained

The literal reconstructed fine-head-tail domain FTC contribution now has:

1. a source-derived second field derivative;
2. `ContDiff ℝ 2`;
3. value zero at the zero field;
4. Fréchet derivative zero at the zero field;
5. an exact radial identity

```text
F_Y(A) = (1 / 2) * inner A (Q_Y(A) A).
```

This is a valid producer-side theorem.  It is not yet the CMP116 residual
bound and must not be counted as a discharged terminal hypothesis.

## Estimate discipline: equations (1.36) and (1.43)

The two source estimates must not be identified:

* `cmp116Eq136ResidualMajorant` bounds the residual `V''_k(Y,B)`;
* `cmp116Eq143QMajorant` bounds matrix elements of the radial quadratic
  operator `Q(Y,B;b,b')`.

Consequently, an operator-norm theorem placing
`cmp102Eq80PhysicalFineHeadTailDomainFTCRadialOperator` below
`cmp116Eq136ResidualMajorant` would mix distinct source objects.  The
source-faithful radial target is instead an equation-(1.43) matrix-element
bound obtained from the literal Hessian along the segment `t • B`.  The
generic no-loss transfer from such a Hessian estimate to the radial operator
already exists in `BalabanCMP116RadialTaylorBound.lean`.  The literal bridge
is now closed by:

```lean
cmp116FDerivHessian_cmp102Eq80PhysicalFineHeadTailDomainFTCContribution
abs_inner_cmp102Eq80PhysicalFineHeadTailDomainFTCRadialOperator_le_eq143
```

in `BalabanCMP102Eq80PhysicalDomainFTCEq143Frontier.lean`.  The first theorem
identifies the Hessian with the reconstructed CMP102
`SecondFieldDerivative`; the second transfers an equation-(1.43) bound on
that concrete derivative to the installed radial operator without loss.
The remaining work is to derive the explicit matrix-element premise from
the CMP102 source jets and domain-decay producers.  The first quantitative
part of that derivation is now closed in
`BalabanCMP102Eq80PhysicalDomainFTCSecondFieldSourceMetricBound.lean`:

```lean
norm_cmp102Eq80PhysicalFineHeadTailDomainFTCContributionSecondFieldDerivative_le_sourceMetric
abs_inner_cmp102Eq80PhysicalFineHeadTailDomainFTCRadialOperator_le_sourceMetric
```

It integrates the existing order-three source-jet estimate through the
literal affine FTC and multiplies it by the already proved
cardinality/tree-metric decay of the reconstructed domain coefficient.  Its
right-hand side is the explicit producer-side quantity
`cmp102Eq80PhysicalDomainFTCSecondFieldSourceMetricMajorant`.  The second
endpoint applies that estimate uniformly along the radial segment and
produces the corresponding matrix-element bound for the literal radial
operator, retaining the two probe norms and introducing no equation-(1.43)
assumption.  The remaining equation-(1.43) step is therefore the physical
production of the uniform source-jet inputs and the scalar comparison of
this explicit majorant with the printed constants `C3`, `epsilon1`, `C2`,
and `kappa1`.

That scalar comparison is now isolated in
`BalabanCMP102Eq80PhysicalDomainFTCEq143SourceMetric.lean`.  It selects

```text
kappaCard   = (kappa1 - 1) * Msource^(-4) / 2
kappaMetric = (kappa1 - 1) / 8
```

and removes every dependence on `Y` from the remaining producer budget.
The reconstruction offsets `exp(kappaCard * 10000)` and
`exp(kappaMetric * 10000)` remain visible in that budget.  They are fixed
smallness thresholds on the walk ratios, not additional decay in the domain
metric.

The scalar cancellation

```text
tau radius (2.18) * residual majorant (1.36)
  = residual domain weight (2.20)
```

is already proved separately in `BalabanCMP116Eq136To220.lean`.  It applies
to `V''_k`, not to the radial operator.

## Next acceptance target

The immediate source-facing target is the missing **residual `V''_k`**.
The repository currently contains
`cmp102Eq80SourcePi4FullyDecoupledResidual`, but that object is only the
all-zero weakening leaf of the equation-(80) sector.  It cannot be identified
with `V''_k`: the latter belongs to the complete localized fluctuation action,
includes the independently localized Lemma-1 energy-difference sector, and
must satisfy (1.36).

The source-faithful split is therefore:

```text
Q_Y branch:
  literal CMP102 connected equation-(80) activity
    -> radial Hessian average -> (1.43) -> (2.19)

V''_k branch:
  complete localized fluctuation action
    - quadratic core selected above
    -> concrete residual -> (1.36) -> (2.20)
```

The primary CMP116 proof makes this residual branch more precise.  Domain by
domain, `V''_k` has two source families:

```text
V''_k(Y)
  = localized Lemma-1 energy-difference activity V'_k(Y)
    + directly bounded F^(k) residual terms assigned to Y.
```

The terms of `F^(k)` carrying a dangerous negative power of `g_k` are the
ones expanded to second order and assigned to `Q(Y,B)`.  They are not a
producer of the Lemma-1 family.  Consequently there is no source-faithful
comparison

```text
cmp116Eq143QMajorant -> cmp116Eq136ResidualMajorant.
```

Any such comparison would conflate the two summands of (1.42).

The first representation layer of the Lemma-1 sector is now present in
`BalabanCMP109LocalizedActionExpansion.lean`.  It records the finite-volume
source form

```text
E_k = sum over (scale j, localization term X) of E^(j)(X),
```

with every term supported on the literal bilateral bond carrier of a
nonempty face-connected `CMP116LocalizationDomain`.  The term index is kept
separate from the domain so that different scales or source species may share
the same carrier.  For two physical gauge backgrounds, the module constructs
canonically the finite set of positive bonds on which their values differ and
proves the exact cancellation identity

```text
changed(U_perturbed,U_base) = {b : U_perturbed(b) != U_base(b)}

E_k(U_perturbed) - E_k(U_base)
  = sum over terms whose local support meets changed(U_perturbed,U_base)
      [E^(j)(X,U_perturbed) - E^(j)(X,U_base)].
```

It also proves that every surviving term's physical domain contains a changed
bond.  Thus neither the carrier nor the agreement-away-from-carrier property
is supplied by the caller.  This is the first source-faithful representation
of the energy difference, but it is not yet the analytic localization
estimate.

The physical fluctuation field entering this sector is now constructed in
`BalabanCMP109ConstraintCorrectionFixedPoint.lean` and
`BalabanCMP109ConstraintCorrectedFluctuation.lean`.  The first module proves
the volume-uniform source-sup bound

```text
|h D|_sup <= L^(d-1) |D|_sup
```

for the literal distinguished-bond right inverse `h`, and applies Banach's
theorem to the source equation

```text
D_tilde(A) = nonlinearCorrection(A - h D_tilde(A)).
```

This is intentionally a new fixed point: it does not reuse the different
CMP99 background minimizer `H`.  The second module defines

```text
B' = g_k C B - h D_tilde(g_k C B)
```

and proves that its flat block constraint is `-D_tilde` and that the complete
linear-plus-nonlinear block constraint vanishes exactly.

The next accepted producer must install this field into the two group-valued
backgrounds displayed in CMP109 (2.12):

```text
E_k(U_k(exp(i [g_k C B - h D_tilde(g_k C B)]) V^(k)))
  - E_k(U_k(V^(k))).
```

The first genuine variational layer of `U_k` is now constructed in
`BalabanCMP109MinimalOrbitExistence.lean`.  For the literal one-step
decimation `2M -> M`, it proves:

```text
blockMap M : GaugeConfig d (2M) SU(Nc) -> GaugeConfig d M SU(Nc)
```

is surjective by an explicit positive-bond lift; every block fiber is compact;
the exact Wilson action is continuous on that fiber; and a chosen physical
background realizes the minimum.  Its public `SU(Nc)` endpoint receives only
the coarse background and satisfies both

```text
blockMap M (U_1(V)) = V
```

and the universal action-minimality inequality on that fiber.  It is not a
pointwise left variation.

This is deliberately only the finite-volume one-step existence theorem.  The
source `U_k` still requires the multiscale block map, uniqueness of the
regular minimizing gauge orbit, an axial-gauge representative, and analytic
dependence on the coarse background.  Those stronger properties are exactly
what permit the CMP109 (1.18) Cauchy/Lipschitz comparison.  Once the two
multiscale backgrounds are literal, that gain, together with rooted-domain
resummation, must construct the Lemma-1 residual family and contribute to the
full `V''_k`.

The current checkpoint does **not** change the terminal score:
the physical `TermSource` remains unconstructed and zero of the five terminal
analytic boundaries are discharged.  A record which merely accepts an
arbitrary residual and an `h136` field would document the frontier but would
not count as discharging it.

After that producer exists, the closed seed contour density can install both
the quadratic and residual branches and the concrete
`CMP116Eq226PhysicalContourTermSource` can discharge `interaction_bound`.

No theorem is to be accepted if it takes that equality, `interaction_bound`,
the complete `TermSource`, `hraw`, or `hprofile` as a renamed premise.
