# hRpoly CMP102 → CMP116 vertical slice

**Date:** 2026-07-28  
**Branch:** `codex/cmp116-interacting-wilson-hessian`  
**Baseline audited:** `d8856a76`

## Purpose

This document replaces job count by a consumer-facing progress metric.  A
checkpoint counts as progress toward the terminal CMP116 theorem only when it
constructs, or removes a hypothesis from, one of the objects consumed by

```lean
cmp116Eq226PhysicalContour_singleScaleUVDecay_boundedHoles_of_boundaries
```

The terminal boundary objects are:

1. a physical contour source family `S`;
2. `CMP116Lemma3Eq229ScaleBoundary`;
3. `CMP116Lemma3PStageSourceScaleBoundary`;
4. `CMP116Lemma3WeightedPostPSourceScaleBoundary`;
5. the scalar decay profile `hprofile`.

The fifth item contains the target time profile
`Real.exp (-(c0 * (t : ℝ)))`; it must therefore be generated from source
parameters rather than treated as a harmless bookkeeping premise.

## Import-graph audit

Before the bridge module introduced after `d8856a76`, no file whose basename
was outside the `BalabanCMP102*` family imported a `BalabanCMP102*` module.
The terminal theorem occurred only in its definition file and its audit file.
Consequently, the CMP102 producer lane compiled but did not feed the CMP116
consumer lane.

The first exact type bridge is now:

```lean
cmp102FineFieldEquivCMP116PhysicalGaugeField
```

in `BalabanCMP116CMP102PhysicalFieldBridge.lean`.  It identifies the plain
physical positive-bond field used by CMP116 with the `PiLp 2` realization
used by CMP102, proves coordinate equality, and proves both round trips.
This bridge discharges no analytic boundary by itself.

## `CMP116Eq226PhysicalContourTermSource` field audit

The source record is the first object that must be constructed physically.
Its current status against the CMP102 lane is:

| Record component | CMP102 producer status |
|---|---|
| `contour` | **missing seed globally**: every current constructor transforms an existing density; no lane constructs a closed initial `CMP116Eq214PhysicalContourDensity` |
| `source` | physical Gamma/operator ingredients exist, but no equality installs them in the contour density |
| `domainMetric`, `domainSupport` | domain geometry exists on the CMP102 side; no typed equality to the contour index family |
| Cauchy-radius identities | generic CMP116 formulas exist; not instantiated by a CMP102 contour producer |
| positivity/smallness scalars | many scalar lemmas exist; no complete source record |
| `outer_bound` | no CMP102-to-contour theorem |
| `inner_bound` | no CMP102-to-contour theorem |
| contour `potential` summand | **CMP102-produced**: the domain radial operator is installed through the existing complex `tau` potential constructor and is proved equal termwise to the literal domain contribution |
| `interaction_bound` | still open: the full exponent also contains the independent `R₂` precision correction |
| `source_bound` | operator/source bounds exist parametrically; no installed contour source |
| `domain_nonempty`, `domain_subset` | geometric ingredients exist; no source-record construction |
| `rooted_residual` | **missing source instance** |
| `volume_budget` | **missing source instance** |

Therefore:

```text
physical CMP116Eq226PhysicalContourTermSource constructed: 0
terminal boundary objects discharged from CMP102:          0 / 5
terminal theorem instantiated nontrivially:                 0
```

## Closed CMP102 result retained

The literal reconstructed fine-head-tail domain FTC contribution now has:

1. a source-derived second field derivative;
2. `ContDiff ℝ 2`;
3. value zero at the zero field;
4. Fréchet derivative zero at the zero field;
5. an exact radial identity

```text
F_Y(A) = (1 / 2) * inner A (Q_Y(A) A).
```

This is a valid producer-side theorem.  It is not yet the CMP116 residual
bound and must not be counted as a discharged terminal hypothesis.

## Estimate discipline: equations (1.36) and (1.43)

The two source estimates must not be identified:

* `cmp116Eq136ResidualMajorant` bounds the residual `V''_k(Y,B)`;
* `cmp116Eq143QMajorant` bounds matrix elements of the radial quadratic
  operator `Q(Y,B;b,b')`.

Consequently, an operator-norm theorem placing
`cmp102Eq80PhysicalFineHeadTailDomainFTCRadialOperator` below
`cmp116Eq136ResidualMajorant` would mix distinct source objects.  The
source-faithful radial target is instead an equation-(1.43) matrix-element
bound obtained from the literal Hessian along the segment `t • B`.  The
generic no-loss transfer from such a Hessian estimate to the radial operator
already exists in `BalabanCMP116RadialTaylorBound.lean`.  The literal bridge
is now closed by:

```lean
cmp116FDerivHessian_cmp102Eq80PhysicalFineHeadTailDomainFTCContribution
abs_inner_cmp102Eq80PhysicalFineHeadTailDomainFTCRadialOperator_le_eq143
```

in `BalabanCMP102Eq80PhysicalDomainFTCEq143Frontier.lean`.  The first theorem
identifies the Hessian with the reconstructed CMP102
`SecondFieldDerivative`; the second transfers an equation-(1.43) bound on
that concrete derivative to the installed radial operator without loss.
The remaining work is to derive the explicit matrix-element premise from
the CMP102 source jets and domain-decay producers.

The scalar cancellation

```text
tau radius (2.18) * residual majorant (1.36)
  = residual domain weight (2.20)
```

is already proved separately in `BalabanCMP116Eq136To220.lean`.  It applies
to `V''_k`, not to the radial operator.

## Next acceptance target

The immediate next definition is the **closed seed contour density**.  The
new CMP102 installer transforms an existing density and therefore cannot
produce a closed contour object by itself.  The seed must provide literal
supports, radii, reference Gaussian data, the reindexed source-Pi4 walk
matrices, determinant density, physical bond field, and threshold.  Applying
the CMP102 potential installer to that seed must then yield the first closed
`CMP116Eq214PhysicalContourDensity`.

Only after the seed and the independent `R₂` precision correction are
present should the combined `interactionExponent` be bounded and used to
discharge the `interaction_bound` field of a concrete
`CMP116Eq226PhysicalContourTermSource`.

No theorem is to be accepted if it takes that equality, `interaction_bound`,
the complete `TermSource`, `hraw`, or `hprofile` as a renamed premise.
