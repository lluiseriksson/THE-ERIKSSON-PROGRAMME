# hRpoly CMP102 → CMP116 vertical slice

**Date:** 2026-07-28  
**Branch:** `codex/cmp116-interacting-wilson-hessian`  
**Baseline audited:** `d8856a76`

## Purpose

This document replaces job count by a consumer-facing progress metric.  A
checkpoint counts as progress toward the terminal CMP116 theorem only when it
constructs, or removes a hypothesis from, one of the objects consumed by

```lean
cmp116Eq226PhysicalContour_singleScaleUVDecay_boundedHoles_of_boundaries
```

The terminal boundary objects are:

1. a physical contour source family `S`;
2. `CMP116Lemma3Eq229ScaleBoundary`;
3. `CMP116Lemma3PStageSourceScaleBoundary`;
4. `CMP116Lemma3WeightedPostPSourceScaleBoundary`;
5. the scalar decay profile `hprofile`.

The fifth item contains the target time profile
`Real.exp (-(c0 * (t : ℝ)))`; it must therefore be generated from source
parameters rather than treated as a harmless bookkeeping premise.

## Import-graph audit

Before the bridge module introduced after `d8856a76`, no file whose basename
was outside the `BalabanCMP102*` family imported a `BalabanCMP102*` module.
The terminal theorem occurred only in its definition file and its audit file.
Consequently, the CMP102 producer lane compiled but did not feed the CMP116
consumer lane.

The first exact type bridge is now:

```lean
cmp102FineFieldEquivCMP116PhysicalGaugeField
```

in `BalabanCMP116CMP102PhysicalFieldBridge.lean`.  It identifies the plain
physical positive-bond field used by CMP116 with the `PiLp 2` realization
used by CMP102, proves coordinate equality, and proves both round trips.
This bridge discharges no analytic boundary by itself.

## `CMP116Eq226PhysicalContourTermSource` field audit

The source record is the first object that must be constructed physically.
Its current status against the CMP102 lane is:

| Record component | CMP102 producer status |
|---|---|
| `contour` | **missing seed globally**: every current constructor transforms an existing density; no lane constructs a closed initial `CMP116Eq214PhysicalContourDensity` |
| `source` | physical Gamma/operator ingredients exist, but no equality installs them in the contour density |
| `domainMetric`, `domainSupport` | domain geometry exists on the CMP102 side; no typed equality to the contour index family |
| Cauchy-radius identities | generic CMP116 formulas exist; not instantiated by a CMP102 contour producer |
| positivity/smallness scalars | many scalar lemmas exist; no complete source record |
| `outer_bound` | no CMP102-to-contour theorem |
| `inner_bound` | no CMP102-to-contour theorem |
| contour `potential` summand | **partially constructed**: the complete CMP102 equation-(80) radial operator is installed, and its fixed quadratic part `Q₈₀(0)` is now separated exactly from the genuine field-dependent residual `Q₈₀(B) - Q₈₀(0)`; the Lemma-1 residual family is separately domain-indexed; the literal cutoff now keeps every radial point of each selected domain projection inside the source small-field ball; the physical third-jet decay, remaining source summands, and (1.36) are open |
| `interaction_bound` | **open**: its terminal residual is `cmp116Eq220ResidualDomainWeight`, so it requires a concrete `V''_k` satisfying (1.36); closing the `Q_Y` branch through (1.43)/(2.19) does not discharge this field |
| `source_bound` | operator/source bounds exist parametrically; no installed contour source |
| `domain_nonempty`, `domain_subset` | geometric ingredients exist; no source-record construction |
| `rooted_residual` | **missing source instance** |
| `volume_budget` | **missing source instance** |

Therefore:

```text
physical CMP116Eq226PhysicalContourTermSource constructed: 0
terminal boundary objects discharged from CMP102:          0 / 5
terminal theorem instantiated nontrivially:                 0
```

## Closed CMP102 result retained

The literal reconstructed fine-head-tail domain FTC contribution now has:

1. a source-derived second field derivative;
2. `ContDiff ℝ 2`;
3. value zero at the zero field;
4. Fréchet derivative zero at the zero field;
5. an exact radial identity

```text
F_Y(A) = (1 / 2) * inner A (Q_Y(A) A).
```

This is a valid producer-side theorem.  It is not yet the CMP116 residual
bound and must not be counted as a discharged terminal hypothesis.

## Estimate discipline: equations (1.36) and (1.43)

The two source estimates must not be identified:

* `cmp116Eq136ResidualMajorant` bounds the residual `V''_k(Y,B)`;
* `cmp116Eq143QMajorant` bounds matrix elements of the radial quadratic
  operator `Q(Y,B;b,b')`.

Consequently, an operator-norm theorem placing
`cmp102Eq80PhysicalFineHeadTailDomainFTCRadialOperator` below
`cmp116Eq136ResidualMajorant` would mix distinct source objects.  The
source-faithful radial target is instead an equation-(1.43) matrix-element
bound obtained from the literal Hessian along the segment `t • B`.  The
generic no-loss transfer from such a Hessian estimate to the radial operator
already exists in `BalabanCMP116RadialTaylorBound.lean`.  The literal bridge
is now closed by:

```lean
cmp116FDerivHessian_cmp102Eq80PhysicalFineHeadTailDomainFTCContribution
abs_inner_cmp102Eq80PhysicalFineHeadTailDomainFTCRadialOperator_le_eq143
```

in `BalabanCMP102Eq80PhysicalDomainFTCEq143Frontier.lean`.  The first theorem
identifies the Hessian with the reconstructed CMP102
`SecondFieldDerivative`; the second transfers an equation-(1.43) bound on
that concrete derivative to the installed radial operator without loss.
The remaining work is to derive the explicit matrix-element premise from
the CMP102 source jets and domain-decay producers.  The first quantitative
part of that derivation is now closed in
`BalabanCMP102Eq80PhysicalDomainFTCSecondFieldSourceMetricBound.lean`:

```lean
norm_cmp102Eq80PhysicalFineHeadTailDomainFTCContributionSecondFieldDerivative_le_sourceMetric
abs_inner_cmp102Eq80PhysicalFineHeadTailDomainFTCRadialOperator_le_sourceMetric
```

It integrates the existing order-three source-jet estimate through the
literal affine FTC and multiplies it by the already proved
cardinality/tree-metric decay of the reconstructed domain coefficient.  Its
right-hand side is the explicit producer-side quantity
`cmp102Eq80PhysicalDomainFTCSecondFieldSourceMetricMajorant`.  The second
endpoint applies that estimate uniformly along the radial segment and
produces the corresponding matrix-element bound for the literal radial
operator, retaining the two probe norms and introducing no equation-(1.43)
assumption.  The remaining equation-(1.43) step is therefore the physical
production of the uniform source-jet inputs and the scalar comparison of
this explicit majorant with the printed constants `C3`, `epsilon1`, `C2`,
and `kappa1`.

That scalar comparison is now isolated in
`BalabanCMP102Eq80PhysicalDomainFTCEq143SourceMetric.lean`.  It selects

```text
kappaCard   = (kappa1 - 1) * Msource^(-4) / 2
kappaMetric = (kappa1 - 1) / 8
```

and removes every dependence on `Y` from the remaining producer budget.
The reconstruction offsets `exp(kappaCard * 10000)` and
`exp(kappaMetric * 10000)` remain visible in that budget.  They are fixed
smallness thresholds on the walk ratios, not additional decay in the domain
metric.

The role of `10000` must nevertheless be stated precisely.  It is the proved
uniform upper budget for the large-block carrier contributed by one literal
walk unit, not a replacement for `domainMetric Y`.  The source-metric
reassembly uses the number of walk units together with the cardinality and
tree-metric lower budgets to produce the genuine final factors

```text
exp (-kappaCard * Y.blocks.card)
  * exp (-kappaMetric * cmp116CubeEdgeTreeMetric Y).
```

Thus the premises

```text
cardRatio   <= exp (-kappaCard * 10000)
metricRatio <= exp (-kappaMetric * 10000)
```

are per-unit contraction requirements.  They are not themselves
domain-decay statements, but the terminal prefactor derived from them does
decay in the two literal domain observables.  Neither premise may be
described as a bound in `d_k(Y)` before that reassembly step.

The scalar cancellation

```text
tau radius (2.18) * residual majorant (1.36)
  = residual domain weight (2.20)
```

is already proved separately in `BalabanCMP116Eq136To220.lean`.  It applies
to `V''_k`, not to the radial operator.

## Next acceptance target

The immediate source-facing target is the missing **residual `V''_k`**.
The repository currently contains
`cmp102Eq80SourcePi4FullyDecoupledResidual`, but that object is only the
all-zero weakening leaf of the equation-(80) sector.  It cannot be identified
with `V''_k`: the latter belongs to the complete localized fluctuation action,
includes the independently localized Lemma-1 energy-difference sector, and
must satisfy (1.36).

The source-faithful split is therefore:

```text
Q_Y branch:
  literal CMP102 connected equation-(80) activity
    -> radial Hessian average -> (1.43) -> (2.19)

V''_k branch:
  complete localized fluctuation action
    - quadratic core selected above
    -> concrete residual -> (1.36) -> (2.20)
```

The primary CMP116 proof makes this residual branch more precise.  Domain by
domain, `V''_k` has two source families:

```text
V''_k(Y)
  = localized Lemma-1 energy-difference activity V'_k(Y)
    + directly bounded F^(k) residual terms assigned to Y.
```

The terms of `F^(k)` carrying a dangerous negative power of `g_k` are the
ones expanded to second order and assigned to `Q(Y,B)`.  They are not a
producer of the Lemma-1 family.  Consequently there is no source-faithful
comparison

```text
cmp116Eq143QMajorant -> cmp116Eq136ResidualMajorant.
```

Any such comparison would conflate the two summands of (1.42).

There is a second distinction which must remain explicit.  The all-zero
weakening branch

```text
cmp102Eq80SourcePi4FullyDecoupledResidual
```

is a leaf of the FTC expansion in the weakening coordinates.  Despite the
legacy identifier, it is not the Taylor residual in the physical field
`B`.  In particular:

```text
weakening FTC:  coupled value = all-zero leaf + connected increments;
field Taylor:   localized V_k = quadratic core + V''_k.
```

These are decompositions in different variables.  The all-zero leaf is a
single anchored scalar, whereas the source residual is a family indexed by
localization domains.  A valid construction of `V''_k` must therefore
provide the missing domain assignment and prove (1.36); it cannot obtain
either fact by renaming the FTC leaf.

`BalabanCMP102Eq80SourcePi4DecoupledLeafRadial.lean` makes this distinction
formal rather than merely terminological.  It gives the legacy all-zero
branch the source-honest alias
`cmp102Eq80SourcePi4FullyDecoupledLeaf`, proves its `C²`, value-zero, and
first-derivative-zero normalizations in the physical field, and constructs
its exact field-radial Hessian operator.  Adding this operator to the
connected-domain radial sum yields the literal identity

```text
equation-(80) physical potential
  = (1/2) <B, CompleteRadialQuadratic(B) B>.
```

Consequently the entire equation-(80) sector is installed in one exact
radial representation, but this does **not** make it a fixed quadratic
functional: `CompleteRadialQuadratic(B)` depends on `B`.  The source-facing
split must instead distinguish

```text
fixed quadratic part = Q₈₀(0),
equation-(80) residual operator = Q₈₀(B) - Q₈₀(0).
```

`BalabanCMP116RadialTaylorResidual.lean` constructs this difference in
general, identifies `Q_f(0)` exactly with the Fréchet Hessian at the origin,
and writes its matrix elements as the radial average of
`D²f(tB) - D²f(0)`.  Instantiating it with the already constructed complete
equation-(80) operator and consuming the existing exact radial identity gives
the scalar split into the fixed quadratic term and the genuine residual term.
This identifies a canonical equation-(80) candidate summand for `V''_k`;
it is not yet the source-level `V''_k`, and it does not prove its
equation-(1.36) bound.  That identification still requires the domain/scale
assembly, while the bound requires a quantitative modulus for the variation
of the physical Hessian along the segment.  Independently, the complete
radial operator can become Balaban's source `Q(Y,B)` only after the domain
dictionary and the matrix-element estimate (1.43) are proved.

The same module records the exact third-order gain that the future producer
must preserve.  If

```text
|D²f(tB)[A',A] - D²f(0)[A',A]|
  <= Lambda(Y) * t * ||B|| * ||A|| * ||A'||,
```

then Lean proves

```text
|<A, (Q_f(B)-Q_f(0)) A'>|
  <= (Lambda(Y)/3) * ||B|| * ||A|| * ||A'||,

|(1/2)<B, (Q_f(B)-Q_f(0)) B>|
  <= (Lambda(Y)/6) * ||B||^3.
```

The constants come from
`2 * integral_0^1 (1-t)t dt = 1/3`.  This does not yet prove (1.36):
`Lambda(Y)` must be produced from the literal equation-(80) third-jet
chain with the source-metric decay, rather than supplied as a free
domain-independent scalar.

`BalabanCMP116RadialHessianThirdJet.lean` now removes the free radial
Hessian-modulus premise from this generic step.  From `f ∈ C³` and a bound
on the literal third Fréchet derivative at every point of `[0,B]`, it derives
the required Hessian difference by a Banach-space mean-value theorem and
then obtains the displayed `Lambda/3` and `Lambda/6` estimates.  Thus the
generic order-three gain is complete.  The physical counter remains open:
the bound on the third derivative must still be instantiated by a
domain-dependent `Lambda(Y)` with the source metric and cardinality decay.

`BalabanCMP102Eq80SourcePi4RadialPackage.lean` removes an independent
elaboration obstacle before that specialization.  It stores the literal
equation-(80) data, regularity, origin normalizations, patch certificate,
and contour restrictions in one dependent record, then exposes the
physical potential, the complete radial operator, and their exact quadratic
identity through short projections.  This is interface compression only:
it does not supply `Lambda(Y)` or move any terminal analytic-boundary field.

There is a separate source/consumer mismatch that must be resolved before
specializing the cubic estimate.  CMP116 proves (1.36) on the small-field
analytic domain (`|B'| <= C1 * epsilon1`), whereas both
`CMP116Eq226PhysicalContourTermSource.interaction_bound` and the corrected
conditioned record's `remainder_bound` quantify over every Gaussian
coordinate vector.  The corrected conditioned route weakens the interaction
inequality itself to an almost-everywhere statement and reaches the
Lemma-3 boundary, but it still assumes the residual estimate uniformly in
that unbounded vector.  Consequently the generic cubic bound cannot yet be
installed source-faithfully: one must either prove a global quadratic-growth
bound for the assembled potential, or formalize the small-field/large-field
decomposition that restricts use of (1.36).  No such bridge is currently
present, so `interaction_bound` remains at `0/5`.

`BalabanCMP116Eq222CutoffSupportInteraction.lean` removes the artificial
global quantifier at the Gaussian-consumer layer.  If the literal cutoff is
zero, the inner integrand is zero; otherwise the module requires the
interaction estimate only on that support and carries it through the
almost-everywhere domination and the integrated equation-(2.24) majorant.
It also proves directly that nonvanishing of the complete cutoff implies
`||bondField b e|| < threshold` for every `e ∈ Y0`.  The remaining
source-facing bridge is now precise: transport these bondwise inequalities
to the norm bound on the assembled `B'` used by (1.36), including whatever
collar/support relation is needed between `Y0`, `Z0`, and the domain `Y`.
This does not yet move the terminal `interaction_bound` counter.

`BalabanCMP116Eq222CutoffSupNormTransport.lean` closes the norm-transport
part of that bridge.  For every physical bond carrier `S ⊆ Y0`, nonvanishing
of the literal signed cutoff implies

```text
cmp98SourceFieldSupNorm
  (physicalBondProjection S (cmp116SourcePhysicalCoordinateCochain b))
    ≤ threshold.
```

This uses the already certified `PiLp ∞` realization of the source norm, so
there is no ambient-volume or support-cardinality loss.  It also answers the
unbounded-`b` objection precisely: outside cutoff support the integrand is
zero, while on cutoff support every localized field whose carrier lies in
`Y0` remains in the printed small-field ball.  The theorem does not claim
that the entire interior-bond carrier of `Z0` lies in `Y0`; the remaining
source obligation is the locality dictionary showing that each equation-(80)
residual indexed by `Y` reads a carrier `S(Y) ⊆ Y0`.  Until that dictionary
and the physical third-jet decay are installed, `interaction_bound` remains
at `0/5`.

`BalabanCMP102Eq80SourcePi4CutoffCarrier.lean` then constructs the missing
inclusion rather than receiving it as a premise.  Every connected physical
equation-(80) label is converted to the literal
`CMP116LocalizationDomain M (2*Q)` with the same block carrier.  For a
selected finite family `D`, its source cutoff carrier is defined by

```text
Y0(D) = union over W in D of bondSupport(W),
```

where `bondSupport(W)` requires both physical endpoints to lie in `W`.
Lean proves `bondSupport(W) ⊆ Y0(D)` for every `W ∈ D`, and combines this
with the cutoff theorem to obtain the source sup-norm bound on the field
projected to `bondSupport(W)`.  Thus the geometric inclusion and the norm
transport are now physical end to end.

An audit of the literal connected-activity definition rules out one tempting
but unjustified next step.  The current constructor accepts global functions
`D`, `D₃`, and `V₀`; its type supplies no locality certificate for them.
Consequently an equality asserting that the activity is unchanged after
projecting the ambient field to `bondSupport(W)` is not derivable from the
current interface.  Such an equality may only be introduced after the
source constructors of those functions prove the required locality.  It
must not be treated as a generic property of the FTC decomposition.

`BalabanCMP102Eq80CutoffRadialResidual.lean` takes the source-safe route that
is already available.  It proves exact homogeneity of
`cmp98SourceFieldSupNorm`, proves that its closed balls are star-shaped, and
therefore derives, on nonzero literal cutoff support,

```text
X in segment(0, projection_bondSupport(W)(B))
  -> cmp98SourceFieldSupNorm X <= threshold.
```

The terminal theorem consumes a third-jet estimate required only on this
small-field ball and feeds it directly into the exact `Lambda/6` cubic
radial-residual estimate.  Thus no global-in-the-Gaussian-coordinate
third-jet premise remains in this bridge.  The analytic frontier is now the
source construction of the domain-decaying third-jet bound on that ball
(or, equivalently, a source locality theorem strong enough to derive it),
followed by its scalar comparison with equation (1.36).

The first source-faithful producer for that analytic frontier is now present.
`BalabanCMP102Eq80SourcePi4ThirdFieldDerivative.lean` extracts the final three
physical-field variables directly from the literal joint equation-(80) jet:

```text
joint jet of order n+3
  -> three-variable physical continuous multilinear map
  -> norm <= joint-jet norm * product of propagator-direction norms.
```

`BalabanCMP102Eq80PhysicalDomainCoefficientThirdFieldDerivative.lean`
specializes this construction to the reconstructed rectangular domain
coefficient.  Its terminal estimate is

```text
norm(third field jet of the literal domain coefficient)
  <= order-four joint source-jet majorant(D,D3,V0)
       * norm(literal reconstructed domain matrix).
```

This is a genuine physical producer: neither the complete third derivative
nor its bound is supplied as an input.  It also preserves the exact
source-metric factor carried by the reconstructed domain matrix.

The consumer-facing derivative identification is now also closed.  A
normed-space slice theorem and the exact order-one propagator extraction
give

```text
norm(iteratedFDeriv 3 of the literal reconstructed coefficient at A)
  <= norm(order-four joint equation-(80) jet at (H,A))
       * norm(literal reconstructed domain matrix).
```

The component source-jet majorant is then substituted on the right.  Thus
the cutoff theorem no longer has to consume a separate mixed-jet extractor:
its `iteratedFDeriv 3` object is the derivative of the literal reconstructed
coefficient function itself.  The remaining source obligation is a
**uniform small-field** order-four component-jet bound with the printed
domain decay, followed by the scalar comparison with equation (1.36).
Neither that bound nor the unrestricted Gaussian `interaction_bound` is
claimed here.

The quantitative implicit-function route to the missing component jets has
now advanced one derivative.  The selected physical correction satisfies a
literal fixed-point equation `g x = T (x, g x)`.  The new module
`QuantitativeFixedPointThirdDerivativeStability.lean` differentiates that
identity once and constructs the derived fixed-point map

```text
A -> DT(x,g(x)) o (id,A)
```

for `A = Dg(x)`.  Applying the already proved second-jet absorption theorem
to this literal map yields a third-jet bound for `g`; no estimate for `D3 g`
is assumed.  Two apparent auxiliary debts are eliminated internally:

```text
uniform bound on D2 g -> Lipschitz bound on Dg,
vertical contraction of T -> vertical contraction of the derived map.
```

The variation premise is also generated internally from a second derivative
of this *literal derived map*.  The source-useful endpoint does not ask for
that bound on arbitrary linear maps: it constructs the convex tube

```text
x in source domain,  norm(A) <= first-jet budget,
```

proves that `(x,Dg(x))` lies in it, and requires the derived-map second jet
only there.  By definition that derivative depends on jets of `T` only
through order three and on jets of `g` only through order two; it cannot
contain the target `D3 g`.  Consequently the only new source obligation is
an explicit tube-local bound for that derivative from the physical
second/third joint jets of `T`.  The existing first- and second-jet budgets
for `g` feed the recurrence directly.

The final assembly must also reconcile three domain index layers:

```text
Lemma-1 producer : CMP116LocalizationDomain 2 (L*N')
equation-(80)    : CMP116LocalizationDomain M (2*Q)
consumer        : Y : Fin nY with an explicit domainMetric
```

The consumer is abstract enough for a finite enumeration, but a
source-faithful scale dictionary must transport both producer families to
one `Fin nY` and identify its `domainMetric`.  No sum across these scales is
claimed before that dictionary exists.

The first representation layer of the Lemma-1 sector is now present in
`BalabanCMP109LocalizedActionExpansion.lean`.  It records the finite-volume
source form

```text
E_k = sum over (scale j, localization term X) of E^(j)(X),
```

with every term supported on the literal bilateral bond carrier of a
nonempty face-connected `CMP116LocalizationDomain`.  The term index is kept
separate from the domain so that different scales or source species may share
the same carrier.  For two physical gauge backgrounds, the module constructs
canonically the finite set of positive bonds on which their values differ and
proves the exact cancellation identity

```text
changed(U_perturbed,U_base) = {b : U_perturbed(b) != U_base(b)}

E_k(U_perturbed) - E_k(U_base)
  = sum over terms whose local support meets changed(U_perturbed,U_base)
      [E^(j)(X,U_perturbed) - E^(j)(X,U_base)].
```

It also proves that every surviving term's physical domain contains a changed
bond.  Thus neither the carrier nor the agreement-away-from-carrier property
is supplied by the caller.  This is the first source-faithful representation
of the energy difference, but it is not yet the analytic localization
estimate.

The physical fluctuation field entering this sector is now constructed in
`BalabanCMP109ConstraintCorrectionFixedPoint.lean` and
`BalabanCMP109ConstraintCorrectedFluctuation.lean`.  The first module proves
the volume-uniform source-sup bound

```text
|h D|_sup <= L^(d-1) |D|_sup
```

for the literal distinguished-bond right inverse `h`, and applies Banach's
theorem to the source equation

```text
D_tilde(A) = nonlinearCorrection(A - h D_tilde(A)).
```

This is intentionally a new fixed point: it does not reuse the different
CMP99 background minimizer `H`.  The second module defines

```text
B' = g_k C B - h D_tilde(g_k C B)
```

and proves that its flat block constraint is `-D_tilde` and that the complete
linear-plus-nonlinear block constraint vanishes exactly.

The corrected field is now installed into the first literal pair of
group-valued backgrounds displayed in CMP109 (2.12):

```text
E_k(U_k(exp(i [g_k C B - h D_tilde(g_k C B)]) V^(k)))
  - E_k(U_k(V^(k))).
```

The first genuine variational layer of `U_k` is now constructed in
`BalabanCMP109MinimalOrbitExistence.lean`.  For the literal one-step
decimation `2M -> M`, it proves:

```text
blockMap M : GaugeConfig d (2M) SU(Nc) -> GaugeConfig d M SU(Nc)
```

is surjective by an explicit positive-bond lift; every block fiber is compact;
the exact Wilson action is continuous on that fiber; and a chosen physical
background realizes the minimum.  Its public `SU(Nc)` endpoint receives only
the coarse background and satisfies both

```text
blockMap M (U_1(V)) = V
```

and the universal action-minimality inequality on that fiber.  It is not a
pointwise left variation.

`BalabanCMP109MultiscaleMinimalOrbitExistence.lean` now iterates this exact
construction through the literal factor-two tower.  It builds a right inverse
at every depth, proves the full block fiber compact and nonempty, and chooses
an `SU(Nc)` Wilson-action minimizer on that fiber.  No fine background,
constraint witness, compactness certificate, or minimizer is supplied by the
caller.

This remains only finite-volume variational existence.  The source `U_k`
still requires uniqueness of the regular minimizing gauge orbit, an
axial-gauge representative, and analytic dependence on the coarse
background.  Those stronger properties are exactly what permit the CMP109
(1.18) Cauchy/Lipschitz comparison.  Once the two regular backgrounds are
literal, that gain, together with rooted-domain resummation, must construct
the Lemma-1 residual family and contribute to the full `V''_k`.

`BalabanCMP109Lemma1PhysicalBackgrounds.lean` closes the first one-step
dictionary.  Banach produces `D_tilde` and its nonlinear chart; the file forms
the genuine special-unitary coarse field

```text
exp(i [g_k C B - h D_tilde]) V
```

and applies the proved one-step Wilson minimizer to that field and to `V`.
Both block equations are exact.  The resulting literal energy difference is
then rewritten as the sum over precisely those inductive local activities
whose support meets the canonical changed-positive-bond set.  No correction
field, perturbation carrier, or minimizer is supplied to the terminal
existence theorem.

`BalabanCMP109Lemma1ResidualFamily.lean` now performs the next exact source
step.  It takes the finite image of the domains actually carried by those
surviving inductive activities and defines

```text
V'_Lemma1(Y)
  = sum of the affected local-activity differences with domainOf(i) = Y.
```

Lean proves both

```text
E_k(U_perturbed) - E_k(U_base) = sum_Y V'_Lemma1(Y)
```

and that a domain outside the canonical affected-domain image contributes
zero.  This is a literal domain-indexed residual family, not an arbitrary
`remainder` supplied by the caller.  It is one source summand of `V''_k`;
the non-dangerous directly bounded terms of `F^(k)` remain to be added.
The only estimate used here is the triangle inequality inside each domain
fiber, so (1.36) is still neither assumed nor proved.

This advances the source dictionary but not the terminal analytic-boundary
count.  `CMP109LocalizedActionExpansion.activity` is intentionally an
arbitrary source local functional and carries no Lipschitz or decay data.
Consequently the first non-tautological analytic theorem must derive the
CMP109 (1.18) comparison for the regular axial-gauge minimizer and the
previous-scale localized activities.  Merely adding a Lipschitz field to the
record would rename that obligation and is not accepted.

The current checkpoint does **not** change the terminal score:
the physical `TermSource` remains unconstructed and zero of the five terminal
analytic boundaries are discharged.  A record which merely accepts an
arbitrary residual and an `h136` field would document the frontier but would
not count as discharging it.

The quantitative fixed-point route has nevertheless removed one generic
regularity obstruction.  `QuantitativeFixedPointDerivedMapSecondJet.lean`
uses the literal derived map

```text
(x,A) |-> DT(x,g(x)) o (id,A)
```

and proves that its graph factor is affine, with first-jet norm at most one
and identically zero second jet.  Consequently, on `|A| <= L1`,

```text
|D^2 fixedPointFirstDerivativeMap(x,A)|
  <= 2 C1 + C2 max(1,L1),
```

where `C1` and `C2` bound the first and second jets of the literal
coefficient `(x,A) |-> DT(x,g(x))`.  No third derivative of the fixed point
is assumed.  Together with the preceding fixed-point absorption theorem,
this makes the remaining source-facing generic obligation precise: derive
these two coefficient-jet bounds from the physical joint jets of `T` through
order three and the already constructed first and second jets of `g`.
Supplying `C1` or `C2` as unexplained physical hypotheses would only rename
that obligation and is not accepted.

After that producer exists, the closed seed contour density can install both
the quadratic and residual branches and the concrete
`CMP116Eq226PhysicalContourTermSource` can discharge `interaction_bound`.

No theorem is to be accepted if it takes that equality, `interaction_bound`,
the complete `TermSource`, `hraw`, or `hprofile` as a renamed premise.
