# `hRpoly` CAMPAIGN — the cluster-expansion-with-holes activity bound

**Live status (2026-06-18).** Core green at **8264 jobs**.  The campaign has
already closed substantial substrate: animal counting, cube summability,
marginal-coupling summability, exponential-decay kernel calculus, Schur/PSD
kernel bounds, Gaussian MGF bounds, concrete finite-dimensional Gaussian
construction, finite-range/resolvent decay, and explicit shell-growth
summability.  The remaining genuinely analytic target is still `hRpoly`: the
concrete Yang-Mills activity-decay estimate for the actual gauge RG operator.

**Original date:** 2026-06-12.  This is the source-grounded campaign document
for discharging `hRpoly`, the **sole remaining genuinely-analytic carried
input** of the end-to-end UV conditional.

## 0. The target

The end-to-end conditional carries
`hRpoly : ∀ t k, |R_{t,k}| ≤ A·e^{−c₀t}·g_k^{κ₀}` — the bound on the
renormalization-group remainder of the two-point function at distance `t`
and scale `k`.  In Bałaban/Dimock this is the OUTPUT of the per-scale RG
step, whose `R_k` is a sum of **renormalized polymer activities** `H^#(Y)`
over boundary-touching polymers `Y`.  Discharging `hRpoly` means proving
that bound from the construction, not assuming it.

## 1. The two genuinely-hard analytic theorems

`hRpoly` decomposes into TWO hard pieces (and one combinatorial input,
largely reduced):

**(A) The fluctuation integral → raw activity bound (Dimock §3.8).**
The Gaussian integration over the fluctuation field `W_k` (covariance
`C_{k,Ω}`, the renormalized propagator) produces local polymer activities
`H_k(X, φ)` with the *raw* exponential bound
`|H_k(X)| ≤ H₀·e^{−κ·d_M(X, mod Ω^c)}`, `H₀` tied to the running coupling
`g_k^{κ₀}` and the field size.  **Needs:** the renormalized Gaussian
measure + its covariance bounds (CMP 95–96; `docs/UV-S2-GAUSSIAN-PLAN.md`
G5).  Mathlib has the `IsGaussian` framework (G1–G4 built) but not the
lattice covariance operator with the Combes–Thomas decay.

**(B) The cluster expansion with holes (Dimock II Appendix F / III).**
Propagates the raw bound (A) to the renormalized activities `H^#(Y)`:
given `|H(X)| ≤ H₀·e^{−κ d_M(X, mod Ω^c)}`, `H₀ ≤ c₀`, `κ ≥ 3κ₀+3`, and
the geometric summability `∑_{X⊇□} e^{−κ₀ d_M(X, mod Ω^c)} ≤ K₀`, then
`Ξ = exp(∑_Y H^#(Y))` with
`|H^#(Y)| ≤ O(1)·H₀·e^{−(κ−3κ₀−3) d_M(Y, mod Ω^c)}`
(`docs/BALABAN-SOURCE-BOUNDS.md` §5).  **Constants flagged for
verification** (see §4).

**(C) The geometric summability** `∑_{X⊇□} e^{−κ₀ d_M} ≤ K₀` is **CLOSED as
graph combinatorics** (ledger Add. 57–60): the animal count `c_n ≤ (Δ²)ⁿ`
(`rooted_connected_card_le_pow`) composed with `polymer_weight_summability`
gives `rooted_connected_weight_summable` (`RG/AnimalTour.lean`):
`∑_Y q^{#Y} ≤ (1−Δ²q)⁻¹` for `Δ²q < 1`.  **Closed: the discrete modified-metric summability**
(identifies Dimock `M`-cube polymers with rooted connected sets, `q = e^{−κ₀}`).

## 2. What is reusable (do NOT rebuild)

* **The abstract Mayer/Kotecký–Preiss cluster expansion** is BUILT:
  `KP.PolymerSystem`, `KP.IsCluster`, `KP.ursell`/`ursellComplete`,
  `KP.clusterSum`, `KP.partition_eq_exp_clusterSum` (+ `_of_kp`,
  `_restrict`, `_singlePolymer`), `KP.cluster_series_summable`,
  `KP.cluster_sum_le`, `KP.kp_per_size_bound` (the per-size/animal-weighted
  geometric bound).  This is the hole-FREE `Ξ = exp(∑ clusters)` + KP
  convergence.
* **The gauge-RG summation/reduction layer** is BUILT:
  `RG.polymer_remainder_bound` (`|∑ H(Y)| ≤ amp·K₀`),
  `RG.geometric_size_summability` (the geometric convergence core),
  `RG.polymer_weight_summability` (`hwK` ⟸ animal-count `c_n ≤ Cⁿ`).
* **The free RG step** (G1–G4): `RG.linAvgCLM`,
  `RG.covarianceBilinDual_map_clm`/`_le` (covariance `↦ Q C Qᵀ`,
  contracts by `‖Q‖²`); `RG.linAvg_l2_contraction` (`L^{2−d}`).
* **The coupling-flow side** is fully discharged:
  `RG.coupling_flow_bridge`, `RG.logistic_geometric_decay`,
  `RG.inv_coupling_linear_growth` (asymptotic freedom).

Generalises `KP` convergence to the modified metric.  **The crux of (B).**  Source audit: Appendix F clusters are `Ω`-connected (`X₁ ∩ X₂ ∩ Ω ≠ ∅`), not ordinary full-polymer touching.  Use the new `omegaHolePolymerSystem` or prove a comparison theorem before reusing `holePolymerSystem` consumers. | code — HARD, months-scale | open (source §4) |
| **P4** | **Fluctuation integral → raw activity bound (§3.8)**: `|H_k(X)| ≤ H₀ e^{−κ d}` from the Gaussian step, `H₀ ∝ g_k^{κ₀}`.  **The crux of (A).** | code — HARD, months-scale, needs the lattice Gaussian covariance | open (source §4) |
| **P5** | **Assemble `hRpoly`**: combine P3 (renormalized decay) + P4 (raw bound) + P1/P2 (summability) ⟹ `|R_{t,k}| ≤ A e^{−c₀t} g_k^{κ₀}`; feed `lattice_mass_gap_of_cluster_and_coupling` ⟹ the **unconditional lattice mass gap**. | code (glue, once P1–P4 land) | open |

**Progress.**  The smallest non-vacuous first code brick (**P1a**, the
bounded-degree walk-count engine `≤ Δⁿ`) is **DONE** — `RG/AnimalCount.lean`,
oracle-clean, core 8253, ledger Add. 57.  It is pure combinatorics over
Mathlib's `SimpleGraph.finsetWalkLength`, needs no Bałaban/Dimock source,
and is the engine for the animal count.  **Next: P1b** — the animal count
`c_n ≤ Cⁿ` itself: build the cube-adjacency graph (degree bound from the
`M`-cube geometry), encode a connected size-`n` polymer as a length-`≤ 2n`
DFS walk rooted at the fixed cube (an injection), then
`Fintype.card_le_of_injective` against P1a gives `c_n ≤ (Δ)^{2n} = C ⁿ`
with `C = Δ²`.  The remaining genuine content is the **encoding injection**
(a connected set ↪ its canonical DFS walk); the count is then immediate
from P1a.  Consumer: `polymer_weight_summability` (closes branch C).

**P1b Mathlib reconnaissance + sub-ladder (design, 2026-06-13).**  Mathlib
*has* the tree predicates — `SimpleGraph.IsTree`, `IsAcyclic`,
`isTree_iff_existsUnique_path` (unique path between any two tree vertices),
`isTree_iff_minimal_connected`, `IsTree.card_edgeFinset` (`#E = #V − 1`) —
but **no Euler-tour / spanning-walk construction** (no "a tree on `m+1`
vertices has a closed walk of length `2m` visiting every vertex").  That
tour is the crux and must be built.  Honest sub-ladder:

* **P1b-i** — *spanning tree of a connected set*: from `G[S]` connected,
  obtain a tree subgraph spanning `S`.  Mathlib route: `Minimal Connected`
  /`Maximal IsAcyclic` (`isTree_iff_minimal_connected`,
  `maximal_isAcyclic_iff_isTree`) + extraction on the finite subgraph.
  Medium; reuses Mathlib.
* **P1b-ii** — *the tree Euler tour* (**the crux, not in Mathlib**): a
  finite tree on `m+1` vertices admits a closed walk from any root of
  length `2m` whose vertex support is all of `V`.  Build by induction on
  `#V` (peel a leaf — `IsTree` has a degree-1 vertex — splice its two
  tour-edges).  **Engine DONE** — `exists_detour_walk` (`RG/AnimalCount.lean`,
  ledger Add. 58): the inductive *step* (splice a `p→u→p` detour into a
  closed walk; length `+2`, support `+{u}`), oracle-clean.  Remaining: the
  leaf-induction *assembly* (iterate the engine over a spanning tree's
  leaves) — `IsTree.exists_vert_degree_one_of_nontrivial` +
  `Connected.induce_compl_singleton_of_degree_eq_one` supply the leaf-peel.
* **P1b-iii** — *the injection + count*: `S ↦ tour(S)` with `S` recovered
  as `(tour S).support.toFinset`, giving injectivity; then
  `Fintype.card_le_of_injective` into `{walks of length 2(n−1) from r}`
  and **P1a** (`card_walks_length_le_degree_pow`) yield
  `c_n ≤ Δ^{2(n−1)} ≤ (Δ²)ⁿ`.  Medium, given P1b-ii.

P1b-ii is a genuine standalone combinatorial development (no Mathlib
primitive); it — not a quick follow-on — is the real next working brick.

## 4. Source material — RECEIVED + corrections (2026-06-13)

The Dimock II/III page-level statements have now been provided and
cross-checked.  Corrections to earlier (second-hand) attributions, now
recorded in `BALABAN-SOURCE-BOUNDS.md` and ledger Add. 61:

1. **Appendix F is in Part II** (arXiv:1212.5562), and its convergence is
   self-contained there (it follows Part I App B) — **NOT** Part III.
   Theorem F.1: `H₀ ≤ c₀`, `κ ≥ 3κ₀+3`, hypothesis `|H(X)| ≤ H₀ e^{−κ d_M(X, mod Ω^c)}`,
   conclusion `|H^#(Y)| ≤ O(1)H₀ e^{−(κ−3κ₀−3) d_M(Y, mod Ω^c)}` — confirmed.
2. The `d_M(X, mod Ω^c)` definition + summability `∑_{X⊇□} e^{−κ₀ d_M} ≤ K₀`
   are in the **§3 main text (§3.1.2, eqs ~150–151)**, not Appendix F.
   `M`-cube adjacency = king-move (shared boundary of any dimension),
   coordination `3^d−1` — now formalized as `cubeAdj` (`RG/CubeLattice.lean`).
3. The raw activity bound is in **§3.14** (Lemma 3.18, eq. ~500/506:
   `|H_{k,Π}^+(Y)| ≤ O(1)L³ λ_k^{1/4−10ε} e^{−L(κ−3κ₀−3) d_{LM}(Y, mod Ω^c)}`),
   **not §3.8** (§3.8 = the fluctuation-integral / covariance-localization
   setup).  Coupling is **`λ_k`** (`= L^{−(N−k)}λ`), not `g_k`;
   `p_k = (−log λ_k)^p`, `α_k = max(λ_k^{1/4}, μ̄_k^{1/2})`; `H₀ ≍ O(1)L³ λ_k^{1/4−10ε}`.

**CRITICAL: Dimock II/III is `φ⁴₃` (3D scalar), not 4D Yang–Mills.**  App F
is a *general polymer lemma* reusable across models, but its constants
(`λ_k^{1/4−10ε}`, `L³`, the *relevant* coupling `λ_k = L^{−(N−k)}λ`) are
`φ⁴₃`-specific.  The 4D YM activity bounds and the (logarithmic, *marginal*)
YM coupling flow must come from Bałaban's YM papers — do NOT transcribe these
`φ⁴₃` numbers into the YM target.

Remaining genuinely-open analytic work (now source-grounded, still large):
**P3** (Appendix F cluster expansion with
holes, on top of the repo's KP layer), **P4** (the §3.14 raw activity bound,
which for YM needs the YM single-scale integral — not the `φ⁴₃` §3.14).

**Cluster-level substrate update (2026-06-19, Addenda 113–120).**  The
cluster-union interface now packages clusters as source-shaped hole polymers
(`clusterUnionPolymer`), controls their active skeleton by the cluster modified
metric, and proves the skeleton-pinned cluster remainder series bound
`clusterSkeletonRemainderSum_tsum_le`.  The follow-on consumer theorem
`clusterSkeletonRemainderSum_tsum_le_metric_bound` composes that KP estimate
with the discrete modified-metric summability theorem: an explicit
Dimock-shaped activity estimate
`exp(t) * ‖z(c)‖ * exp(|c|) ≤ A * q^(d_M(c)+1)` implies a volume-uniform
bound by `t⁻¹ * A * (1 - (3^d)^2 * (q * 2^(3^d+1)))⁻¹`.  The follow-up
`clusterSkeletonRemainderSum_tsum_le_metric_bound_of_local` derives the
needed tilted KP criterion from the local tilted activity-sum smallness
condition, using `holePolymerSystem_KPCriterion_volumeUniform_scaled`.  This
scaled local criterion also now feeds the tilted cluster-series convergence
and tilted norm-bound APIs, plus the local versions of raw-tail summability,
the quantitative raw-pinned bound, skeleton-tail summability, and the
pre-metric skeleton-pinned bound.  Addendum 120 names the
`ρ = exp(t)` specialization directly as
`holePolymerSystem_KPCriterion_volumeUniform_exp` and its convergence/norm
companions, so RG proofs can consume the source-shaped
`exp(t) * ‖z(Y)‖ * exp(|Y|)` local window without rebuilding scalar-norm
bookkeeping.  This does **not** prove the P3/P4 activity-decay theorem; it
proves the exact summability consumer interface that P3/P4 must feed.

**Appendix-F compatibility audit (2026-06-19).**  Direct source extraction
from Dimock II Appendix F confirms the with-holes cluster relation:
`Ω`-connected means `X₁ ∩ Ω` and `X₂ ∩ Ω` intersect, equivalently
`X₁ ∩ X₂ ∩ Ω ≠ ∅`; `Ω`-disjoint need not be disjoint.  The existing
`holePolymerSystem` remains the touching hard-core system supporting the
verified local-KP consumers, but it is not to be advertised as the literal
Appendix-F compatibility relation.  The new `omegaHolePolymerSystem`
uses nonempty active skeletons and incompatibility by skeleton intersection,
giving P3 a source-faithful entry point.  The follow-up source-facing local
KP package is now also theorem-fed:
`omegaHolePolymerSystem_KPCriterion_volumeUniform_skeleton_exp` and its
convergence/norm companions show that a local window pinned at active skeleton
cubes is enough to run the KP convergence machinery for the literal
Appendix-F relation.  This still carries the model-specific activity estimate;
it closes the consumer side, not the Yang-Mills activity-decay theorem.  The
metric-bound bridge
`omegaHolePolymerSystem_KPCriterion_volumeUniform_skeleton_exp_of_metric_bound`
now derives that local KP window from the source-shaped pointwise estimate
`exp(t)‖z(Y)‖exp(|Y|) ≤ A q^(d_M(Y)+1)` plus the discrete modified-metric
summability already proved in P2b.  Its direct convergence and norm-bound
companions package the same metric-bound hypotheses all the way to the
active-system Mayer cluster series.
The active relation now also has a cluster-tail consumer:
`omegaClusterSkeletonRemainderSum_tsum_le_metric_bound` defines the
Appendix-F-facing skeleton-pinned remainder term and bounds its `tsum` by
`t⁻¹ A (1 - (3^d)^2(q 2^(3^d+1)))⁻¹` under the same pointwise
modified-metric activity majorant.  Thus future P3/P4 work can feed the
literal `Ω`-connected relation without detouring through the older touching
hard-core system.
The same active cluster-tail path also has local-window consumers
`omegaClusterSkeletonRemainderSum_summable_of_local` and
`omegaClusterSkeletonRemainderSum_tsum_le_of_local`: if a primary source gives
the activity estimate as a local active-skeleton polymer norm rather than a
literal pointwise metric majorant, the repo can consume that form directly.
The uniform local-window variants
`omegaClusterSkeletonRemainderSum_summable_of_uniform_local` and
`omegaClusterSkeletonRemainderSum_tsum_le_of_uniform_local` package the common
source form `local active-skeleton norm ≤ B ≤ 1`, yielding the tail bound
`≤ t⁻¹ B` without exposing the root-pinned finite sum in downstream statements.

### P4 route refinement: collar factorization from covariance decay

Lluis Eriksson's outlook paper
`The Heisenberg Cut as a Resource Boundary` (`ai.vixra:2512.0064v1`) should not
be imported literally into `YangMillsCore`: its thermodynamic power,
battery-assisted operations, Heisenberg-cut interpretation, and Type-III
maintenance discussion are a different physical programme.  The useful
mathematical idea is narrower and source-compatible:

`auxiliary RG spectral mass / coercivity → ExpDecay covariance → collar
suppression → local decoupling`.

The first theorem from this route is now in `KernelSchur.lean`:
`expDecay_separated_finset_sum_le`.  If `|K i j| ≤ a exp(-κ d(i,j))` and two
finite regions are separated by a collar `ε`, then

`Σ_{i∈A,j∈B} |K i j| L_i M_j ≤ a exp(-κ ε) (Σ_i L_i)(Σ_j M_j)`.

This is the deterministic algebraic core that a future Gaussian interpolation
proof will consume after integration by parts supplies the derivative weights.
It does not prove the Yang-Mills fluctuation-integral activity bound; it
removes one clean finite-sum step between covariance decay and polymer
decoupling.

The same block-1 audit also identifies a separate, local large-field cutoff
dictionary: Bałaban's analytic logarithmic coordinate must be compared to the
geometric group deviation through `Y = D - 1`, not through `D` itself.  This is
now a verified near-identity theorem in `NearLog.lean`:
`norm_nearLog_two_sided_of_norm_le_third`, namely

`‖Y‖ ≤ 1/3 → ‖Y‖ ≤ 2‖nearLog Y‖ ∧ ‖nearLog Y‖ ≤ 2‖Y‖`.

This is a **green** local cutoff-conversion brick.  The much stronger claim
that a conditioned fast-field measure is literally Bałaban's `T`-operation
remains an **amber/dark** interface until the disintegration and density
comparison are reconstructed from the primary Bałaban source.

The later paper audit also sharpens a potentially shorter covariance route:
the scalar UV assembly consumes a terminal decay estimate, so some of the full
renormalized-activity machinery may be bypassable if one can prove the needed
single-scale covariance/influence decay directly.  The first safe Lean brick
of that route is now in `AveragingAdjoint.lean`: the scaled Hilbert-space
averaging map `scaledLinAvgCLM` on bond `ℓ²`/`PiLp 2` spaces and its adjoint
mass `qMassCLM = Q†Q`, with the energy identity, positivity, and
`‖Q†Q‖ ≤ ‖Q‖²`.  The scalar normalization is deliberately left as `s : ℝ`.
This is only the deterministic mass algebra for a future Gaussian block
kernel; the finite-range kernel, Hessian coercivity, influence matrix, and
activity-decay theorem remain open.

A separate SUSY-style audit is recorded in
`docs/SUSY-HRPOLY-ACCELERATION-PLAN.md`.  It does **not** add a supersymmetric
physical theory to the Clay target.  Its useful content is an abstract
cohomological cancellation layer: decompose local activities as `H = Q B + R`,
use an exact or approximate Ward identity to kill the `Q`-exact part before
norming, and feed the remaining scalar profile to the existing with-holes KP
consumers.  The opening substrate is `YangMills/SUSY/WardComplex.lean`, plus
the regulator-limit bridge `YangMills/RG/ActivityLimit.lean`.
The regulator bridge now includes the telescopic form
`activity_profile_bound_of_tendsto_telescope`: a pointwise regulator sequence
with initial amplitude `amp` and summable profile-weighted increments of total
budget `S` passes to a limiting activity with amplitude `amp + S`.
The next bridge is now also theorem-fed in `YangMills/SUSY/WardPolymer.lean`:
an exact or approximate Ward decomposition of the raw activity produces the
literal pointwise modified-metric hypothesis consumed by
`omegaClusterSkeletonRemainderSum_tsum_le_metric_bound`.  This closes the
consumer side of the Ward route; the model-specific decomposition, regulator
defect estimate, primitive bound, and cohomological remainder bound remain
open.

The kinetic-sweep audit also recommended separating the final scalar consumer
from its possible producers.  This is now theorem-fed in
`YangMills/RG/SingleScaleUVDecay.lean`:

* `SingleScaleUVDecay` is the scalar per-scale estimate consumed by
  `UVMassGap`;
* `RawYMActivityDecay` names the pre-renormalized fluctuation-integral profile;
* `RenormalizedHoleActivityDecay` names the Appendix-F with-holes output
  profile;
* `singleScaleUVDecay_of_renormalizedHoleActivities` proves the actual
  summation bridge from renormalized activities plus `∑ w ≤ K₀` to scalar
  `SingleScaleUVDecay`.

This permits parallel producers such as Appendix F, direct covariance, or Ward
cancellation to target the same scalar interface without relabelling their
unproved analytic inputs.

The first constructive F.1 substrate is now `YangMills/RG/LocalFunctional.lean`.
It follows the "locality in the types" design: a `LocalFunctional` can only
evaluate a `RestrictedField` on its finite support, and a two-field
`LocalActivity` has separate spectator/fluctuation supports.  The global
adapters satisfy oracle-clean invariance theorems under changes off support,
and finite products automatically carry the union of supports.  This is the
typed locality layer that the next F.1 constructions should consume; it is not
Appendix F itself.

The ultralocal independence substrate is now
`YangMills/RG/UltralocalFactorization.lean`.  It proves that two
`LocalFunctional`s with disjoint supports factorize under an explicit finite
product probability measure, and that two `LocalActivity`s with disjoint
fluctuation supports factorize for a fixed spectator field.  This is the
finite product-measure step needed by future fluctuation-integral compilers;
it is not the Gaussian covariance estimate, not the Appendix-F polymer loss,
and not the Yang-Mills activity-decay theorem.

The raw local Mayer step is now in `YangMills/RG/RawMayerWithHoles.lean`.  It
defines `rawMayer` on both `LocalFunctional` and two-field `LocalActivity` as
`H ↦ exp H - 1`, preserving supports by construction, inheriting the
off-support invariance theorem, and proving the elementary small-activity
bound `‖exp z - 1‖ ≤ 2‖z‖` under `‖z‖ ≤ 1`.  This is the local `H_X ↦ m_X`
map of the future Dimock-F.1 compiler, not the Ω-connected cover, not
ultralocal integration, and not the Yang-Mills activity-decay estimate.

The next source-shaped cover substrate is now in
`YangMills/RG/OmegaConnectedCover.lean`.  It defines the Ω-overlap graph on
cover indices, the predicate/structure carrying Ω-connectedness, and the
finite Mayer-cover activity `∏ᵢ (exp Hᵢ - 1)` as a type-local `LocalActivity`.
The spectator and fluctuation supports are exactly the unions of the supports
of the factors, and global evaluation is the product of the raw Mayer factors.
This is still algebraic F.1 scaffolding: it records the combinatorial
Ω-connected cover and product locality, but it does not perform ultralocal
integration, prove the Appendix-F polymer loss, or establish the Yang-Mills
activity-decay bound.

The disconnected-cover compiler now has a graph-level handoff in
`YangMills/RG/MayerCoverFactorization.lean`: `fluctuationOverlapGraph` records
overlap of activity fluctuation supports, and
`mayerCoverActivity_union_integral_of_no_cross_fluctuationAdj` proves that two
disjoint index blocks with no cross-edge in that graph satisfy the finite
Mayer-cover integral split.  This is still finite algebra plus product-measure
independence; it does not identify the source-specific Appendix-F components
or prove any quantitative polymer loss.

The same module also defines `confinedComponent G K r`, the finite component
of a root inside a cover index set using only walks whose support remains in
`K`.  The theorem
`mayerCoverActivity_integral_split_confinedComponent` packages the automatic
split of `K` into that component and its complement under the
fluctuation-overlap graph.  This is the component-extraction producer for the
no-cross-edge theorem above.

The finite all-components layer is now explicit as `confinedComponents G K`.
It proves `(confinedComponents G K).biUnion id = K`, that intersecting
confined components are equal, and hence that distinct confined components are
disjoint.  This is still the finite compiler substrate only: it prepares the
n-ary component factorization over a Mayer cover, but it does not prove
Dimock Appendix F, source-specific activity decay, or any continuum statement.

That n-ary finite factorization is now also theorem-fed:
`mayerCoverActivity_biUnion_integral_of_no_cross_components` proves the
generic product formula over a finite family of pairwise disjoint blocks with no
cross-edge in the fluctuation-overlap graph, and
`mayerCoverActivity_integral_factor_confinedComponents` instantiates it for the
confined-component partition of a cover `K`.  This removes the need to iterate
the binary root/complement split by hand in future finite F.1 compiler work.

The component partition now also connects back to the source-shaped Ω-cover
API.  `confinedComponent_walkConnected` proves that a confined component is
walk-connected in the ambient graph, and
`OmegaConnectedCover.confinedComponentCover` packages a confined component of
the Ω-overlap graph as an `OmegaConnectedCover` with the same index set,
Ω-region, and active-support map.  The theorem
`exists_confinedComponentCover_of_mem_confinedComponents` lifts every member
of `confinedComponents (omegaOverlapGraph Ω activeSupport) K` to such a cover.
This is still finite compiler algebra: it supplies the handoff from
disconnected component extraction to the existing Ω-connected Mayer-product
API, not the analytic Appendix-F activity estimate.

For distinct confined components of the Ω-overlap graph,
`omegaActiveSupport_disjoint_of_mem_confinedComponents_ne` and its pairwise
wrapper convert the graph separation back to the source-facing statement
`Disjoint (Ω ∩ activeSupport i) (Ω ∩ activeSupport j)` across component
indices.  This is the exact finite separation fact a later Appendix-F compiler
needs before applying any model-specific activity estimate.

The canonical family interface is now also theorem-fed:
`confinedComponentCoverOfComponent` chooses an `OmegaConnectedCover` for a
known member of `confinedComponents`, `confinedComponentCoverFamily` indexes
these covers by the subtype of components, and
`biUnion_confinedComponentCoverFamily_index_eq` proves that the union of the
family's cover indices is exactly the original finite set `K`.  The companion
`pairwise_omegaActiveSupport_disjoint_confinedComponentCoverFamily` packages
the pairwise Ω-active separation directly at the cover-family level.
The index partition itself is explicit:
`disjoint_confinedComponentCoverFamily_index_of_ne` and
`pairwise_disjoint_confinedComponentCoverFamily_index` prove that distinct
entries of this family have disjoint index sets.
The source-to-measure bridge is also explicit:
`LocalActivity.mayerCoverActivity_fluctuationSupport_subset_omega_biUnion_activeSupport`
and
`OmegaConnectedCover.mayerActivity_fluctuationSupport_subset_omega_biUnion_activeSupport`
lift factorwise containment
`(H i).fluctuationSupport ⊆ Ω ∩ activeSupport i` to the corresponding
Mayer-cover product support containment inside the union of declared active
supports.
The same source-facing product API now has a pointwise quantitative bound:
`LocalActivity.norm_globalEval_mayerCoverActivity_le_prod_two_of_norm_le` and
`OmegaConnectedCover.norm_globalEval_mayerActivity_le_prod_two_of_norm_le`
show that factorwise raw estimates `‖Hᵢ‖ ≤ Aᵢ ≤ 1` imply
`‖∏ᵢ (exp Hᵢ - 1)‖ ≤ ∏ᵢ 2Aᵢ`.
The uniform-amplitude forms
`LocalActivity.norm_globalEval_mayerCoverActivity_le_two_mul_pow_card_of_norm_le`
and
`OmegaConnectedCover.norm_globalEval_mayerActivity_le_two_mul_pow_card_of_norm_le`
specialize this to the source-common profile
`‖∏ᵢ (exp Hᵢ - 1)‖ ≤ (2A)^{|I|}`.
The decay forms
`LocalActivity.norm_globalEval_mayerCoverActivity_le_two_mul_pow_of_le_card`
and
`OmegaConnectedCover.norm_globalEval_mayerActivity_le_two_mul_pow_of_le_card`
then turn any source-proved lower bound `n ≤ |I|` into
`‖∏ᵢ (exp Hᵢ - 1)‖ ≤ (2A)^n`, provided `2A ≤ 1`.
`LocalActivity.fluctuationOverlapGraph_adj_imp_omegaOverlapGraph_adj_of_fluctuationSupport_subset`
proves the graph-level adapter: if each local fluctuation support is contained
in its declared `Ω ∩ activeSupport i`, then every actual fluctuation-overlap
edge is an Ω-overlap edge.
`LocalActivity.mayerCoverActivity_integral_factor_confinedOmegaComponents_of_fluctuationSupport_subset`
proves that the confined Ω-overlap components factorize the ultralocal
fluctuation integral whenever each local fluctuation support is contained in
its declared `Ω ∩ activeSupport i`.
The cover-family-facing wrapper
`OmegaConnectedCover.mayerActivity_integral_factor_confinedComponentCoverFamily_of_fluctuationSupport_subset`
rewrites the product directly over `confinedComponentCoverFamily`, so later
source compilers do not need to unfold raw component finsets.

All three PDFs (1108.1335, 1212.5562, 1304.0705) are uploaded; the
request was for the **specific page-level theorem statements** so the Lean

## 5. Honest difficulty + Clay scope

P1 is tractable (combinatorics).  **P3 and P4 are the genuine
months-scale cores** — the cluster expansion with holes and the
fluctuation integral — for which Mathlib has no primitives (no polymer
animal model, no lattice Gaussian covariance operator with Combes–Thomas
decay).  Even a full P1–P5 discharge yields only the **lattice** (M3)
mass gap; M4 (continuum limit) and M5 (OS/Wightman reconstruction) remain
untouched open mathematics.  **Distance to the Clay prize: ~0% (<0.1%),
unchanged** — and every status document is required to say so.
